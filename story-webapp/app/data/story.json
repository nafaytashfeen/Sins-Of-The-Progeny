      "content": "<p>The wind howled, cutting through my ears like a blade. The whites and greys of the storm blinded my sight. I clutched my bad arm, wincing with each step from the pain of the fall. The fall hadn’t broken my arm, yet the pain was only magnified by the bleak winds that surrounded me. I wore clothes suited for the Northern summer, not whatever frigid climate I was dropped in. Would this be my undug grave? Would anyone even find me here? I shivered violently at the thought. The overbearing wind only howled in response, clouding my thoughts. </p><p>I trudged forward through the snow stubbornly, leaving knee deep footprints. The deep snow made each step a battle, a war I could not endure forever. The snow climbed up deep into my trousers, and the cold sank deep into my bones. The fog clung to the landscape like a thick veil, leaving the world in a shade of white and blue. I had to keep moving, for if I stopped, I would not be able to pick myself up again. </p><p>As the winds slowed down, my mind cleared with it. To my left I could just make out the rocky cliffside of a mountain. I did not know how I got on that mountain, but I did know I had to keep moving forward until something—anything—happened. Deep down, I knew no one would find me here, that even if there were people on this miserable mountain, they would not find me in this storm. </p><p>Panic surged momentarily, but I forced it down. Panic would do nothing, I shifted my focus on trying to find cover, maybe a rock or small crevice that I could hide behind. My blood threatened to simply freeze, and my limbs groaned with each move. Still hope whispered in my ears—if I was thrown out here, it must have been for some reason. If my abductor wanted to kill me, they could’ve done it already.</p><p>My feet began to numb and lose any sensation, I tried to run but with the deep snow, I only tripped face first. As I stumbled through the snow, the pain in my arm only got worse with each passing step. I wanted to scream, but nature would not hear my cries, would not gain any satisfaction nor hate. I kept trudging through the snow, praying for  some semblance of humanity on this dreaded, frozen mountain. </p><p>The cold sliced at my eyes, my vision worsening, each breath was agony. In my delirium, the streaks of gray and white merged into a surreal canvas. I saw fleeting shapes, not of the warm embrace of family nor the comfort of home, but something else, strange faces, distant landscapes I’d never visited, faces I didn’t recognize, places I hadn’t yet been.</p><p>I do not know how long I laid there in the snow. My breath slowed, time blurred, and the snow pressed against my body. My breath came in short gasps, oxygen a blessing to come by. I closed my eyes, not to sleep, not to dream, but since there was nothing more to see, nothing left to take. This would be my resting place, maybe I—</p><p>Pain shot up my ribs as a heavy boot struck me, not hard enough to break anything, but enough to jolt my body into motion. I gasped, snow spraying from my lips.</p><p>“Oi, what the hell are ye doin’ out here kid”</p><p>The voice was ragged, angry, but human. I blinked through the snow, eyes bleary, I saw a man wrapped in thick furs, face shadowed by his hood.</p><p>He crouched down until I could barely make out his face, he squinted and looked me up and down. </p><p>“You ain’t dead yet, are ya?”</p><p>The man muttered something incoherent under his breath, then reached down and grabbed me by the collar, dragging me to my feet roughly.</p><p>“Damn bloody fool, you’re lucky I found ya.”</p><p>Praise the Light. I didn’t feel lucky, but I was alive.  </p><p><a id=\"_41visi41u8fp\"></a></p><p><a id=\"_v4iewe9zd6b8\"></a></p>"

      "content": "<p>“The name’s Faux, what’s yours?”</p><p>I opened my mouth, lips barely moving “Rand’ar.”</p><p>He grunted in response and pulled out a blanket made of animal hide from his large pack. The blanket was lined with age and stiff from the cold, its edges frayed and thin. </p><p>“Here, wrap this around yourself kid”, he said, his face turning to mine. The warmth of the blanket felt like a sweet respite—it felt like a mercy.</p><p>The man’s age was hard to determine just by looking at his face, hooded as it was. His features seemed to shift with every glance, he could have been in his late twenties, or perhaps somewhere in his forties. He had a disheveled beard, barely three inches long, which gave a rough, unkempt look, yet the shape of his jaw was strongly defined, betraying youthful vitality. A pale scar ran down from his right eye down to the corner of his lip, twisting every time he spoke. His expression was guarded, as if unsure of what to do with me, so I made things easy for him. </p><p>“Where are we going?”, I asked, my voice hoarse, barely above a whisper. </p><p>“Ye gotta speak up, can barely hear shit in this wind” he replied without sparing a glance at me.</p><p>“I said, where are we going?”, I repeated, louder this time and slightly irritated. </p><p>“Somewhere warmer than this. It’s easier to just show you” he said, not easing my fears, but I continued walking with him. What choice did I really have?</p><p>“It ain’t much further from here”, he added. My feet had turned to jelly, snow was packed deep into my trousers, my legs had gone so cold, I could hardly even notice it anymore. </p><p>“How do you even know where we’re going? I can’t see shit”, I asked, my tone casual, but I was watching him carefully. If he really knew this terrain, I needed to know how. If I had to run or hide, I’d need some idea of where we were, or where he might take me.</p><p>He didn’t answer right away, as if formulating his answer, just kept walking through the snow with an air of confidence.</p><p>“There’s markings on the stones or some of the trees. Can’t see ‘em unless ya know what to look for.”</p><p>Our path veered to the left, I was careful to make a mental image of the location. There were orange markings marked in a nearby rock. I slowed just a little as we passed the rock, letting my eyes linger on the markings. Faded orange paint, two slashes intersected by a horizontal line. Quick, deliberate, and almost easy to miss if you weren’t looking for it.</p><p>“I got separated from my group. They must be looking for me”, I said, lying through my teeth. </p><p>“They better find shelter soon then, else they’ll be dead before they find ya”, he replied without looking at me. He didn’t sound convinced, I couldn’t blame him, my bewildered state and summer clothes was telling. But if he doubted me, his face never betrayed it. </p><p>The fog pressed in close, a wall of white that surrounded us, I made sure to keep close to Faux.. My legs, which had turned to jelly, somehow kept moving. Each step felt like lifting a stone, and each breath inhaled icy air that pierced my lungs.</p><p>The hill soon flattened out and I could see other footprints ahead of us. Not as deep as ours, the snow had filled them in. Wherever Faux was taking me, we were close to it. </p><p>The path widened greatly and through the thick curtain of mist I saw the silhouette of a tremendous gate. Two pillars of turquoise and white, adorned with hints of gold rising out of the mists like sentinels. Between them hung a massive portcullis, its iron teeth rusted but still imposing, suspended just above the path. Looming above the gate was a watchtower, its whites and grays almost invisible in the fog. The gate must have been two or three times Faux’s height, who was a head and a half taller than me. Above in the watchtower, I could see figures moving behind the slitted windows. Faux raised a hand and made a quick gesture I couldn’t catch, and after a moment, the gate creaked to life and slowly lifted.</p><p>“We’ve a doctor in the lower grounds, she’ll fix ya up, then you’ll be on yer way” Faux said, the sounds of the chains pulling the portcullis rattling in the background.</p><p>I lingered for a moment under the gate. If I went through the gate, I’d be in their hands—whoever those people were. But no other choice presented itself, I’d be dead within the hour out there in the storm. And who knows where my abductors were, or what they really wanted. Why drop me here of all places? Why leave me alive?</p><p>Faux couldn’t answer those questions, and I didn’t trust him enough to ask. So I stood there, the portcullis yawning above me like a jaw of iron teeth. I wondered how long it’d been since I was taken from home. Hours? Days? </p><p>I must have looked like a fool standing under the gate for so long. Faux had already started walking forward toward what looked like a small village. I followed after him before I lost him in the thick fog.</p><p>The settlement was underwhelming after the massive gate. A handful of stone buildings huddled close to one another, their rooftops heavy with snow and their chimneys coughing out trails of smoke. There was a main path leading further uphill hidden behind thick fog but we turned into a smaller alley. The alley was tight and uneven, worn by weather and footsteps. There were no signs, no stalls, but Faux knew exactly where to go. </p><p>We stopped in front of a two storey building with a dark wooden door. The building looked older than most I’d seen so far, there weren’t many windows, one side made entirely of gray bricks, devoid of any charm, lacking the grandeur of the gate we’d seen. </p><p>Faux knocked three times before the doctor finally opened the door. I expected an old man given the withered building, but a woman in what appeared to be her mid-thirties opened it. She had a serious, worn look about her, like someone who'd seen too many patients too far gone to save.</p><p>She gave me a once-over, then sighed through her nose. “What have you dragged in this time, Faux?”</p><p>“A straggler”, he said. “Claims he got separated by his group on the mountain.”</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “And you believed that?”</p><p>“I didn’t say that,” Faux replied, brushing past her. “He’s frostbitten in both hands, maybe his feet too. Right arm’s useless, probably sprained, maybe worse. He needs heat, salve, and whatever you’ve got for the shakes.”</p><p>She sighed and then stepped aside without another word, already turning toward a cluttered shelf of supplies. “I hope you’re not expecting a miracle.”</p><p>“I’m expecting him not to die in yer doorway.” Faux said. “He’s gotta be in one piece when he sees Lord Astaron.”</p><p>The doctor stilled for half a second, then gave a quiet, almost imperceptible sigh. Her eyes flicked to me, more curious now than concerned.</p><p>“Right”, she said, grabbing a cloth and a tin from a nearby shelf. “I’ll keep him breathing.”</p><p>Faux had already walked out by then, the door left open and the cold wind poisoned the room with sharp air. </p><p>“Shut the door and sit down here will you?”, the doctor said as she pulled out a rickety wooden chair. </p><p>I shut the door behind me, sealing out the storm. A serene silence filled the room, I unwrapped the blanket Faux gave me earlier, the decrepit thing had kept me alive. The chair creaked as I lowered myself into it, every joint in my body protesting. The doctor worked in silence, her hands quick and practiced, dabbing warmth into frozen skin, wrapping my arm without asking too many questions.</p><p>I didn’t ask any either, I had my own worries to sort through. A Lord Astaron was waiting.</p><p><a id=\"_ppbrb9n81fyd\"></a></p>"

      "content": "<p>“I don’t know how you survived honestly”, Doctor Oroya said as she brewed a pot of coffee. The steam curled around her face, softening her otherwise stern expression.</p><p>“You should have died within the hour, even if Faux did find you, you should’ve been frozen, but you walked in here. Summer clothes, no gear, yet you were moving out and about”, she shook her head, almost disbelieving my recounting of what happened. I hadn’t told her about the kidnapping, unsure why. Maybe it didn’t matter by then.</p><p>“Either you’re absurdly lucky, or someone up there’s looking out for you”, she poured a cup and offered it to me.</p><p>“I don’t drink coffee”, I muttered.</p><p>“Suit yourself,” she said, setting it down with a shrug.</p><p>I rubbed the sleep from my eyes. I had slept for so long after the day before's misadventures, too long almost.  I remembered her tending to me the night before, muttering to herself as she tenderly removed my soaked clothes. She wrapped my bad arm, checked my hands, and made me drink something bitter but warm that brought me back to life. Then she handed me a folded set of clothes and pointed me to a room on the second floor to sleep in. I don’t even remember lying down, only the warmth and fuzzy feeling of wearing new clothes. </p><p>A servant girl made breakfast in the kitchen, she must have been a Marshin. She looked younger than me, yet she worked meticulously. I felt a pang of shame just looking at her, me wrapped in clean clothes, being tended to, her toiling in servitude at such a young age. We were the same, yet our lives were so far apart, I could never feel her struggle. </p><p>“I do warn you, Rand'ar, speak the truth when you stand before Lord Astaron. He’ll see through lies before you finish breathing them. That expedition tale of yours won’t hold for long.”</p><p>She paused, her eyes looking into her mug, as if the coffee was particularly interesting. </p><p>“You don’t have to tell me what happened, but tell <em>him</em>—do it for yourself. You can’t have happened here by accident…”, she trailed off. Her eyes were distant, insinuating, like I’d faked my injuries, my story to get into this place. That I was sent here with an agenda. How could I tell her or this Astaron my real story without seeming even more ridiculous. I just happened to be kidnapped and dropped on one of your scouts paths, how convenient. They’d never believe me. </p><p>And who was this Lord Astaron, anyway? Why was a meager village guarded by such a grand gate? Was this man seriously calling himself the lord of <em>this</em> place? The man certainly had a taste for theatrics. </p><p>“Then why’d you save me?”, I asked, a hint of irritation in my voice. I could not bring myself to look at her.</p><p>“I’m a doctor, my job is to help people, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from.” She reached out and placed a hand on my arm, “And I’m still trying to help you here”,</p><p>“How can I even explain it to you? You wouldn’t believe me even if I told you the truth.” I almost shouted, and reminded by the servant girl’s presence, lowered my voice. </p><p>Doctor Oroya didn’t flinch. She just crossed her arms, watching me with a soft expression. </p><p>“I’m not asking you to trust me,” she said. “But shouting won’t change where you are. And pretending none of this happened won’t get you home.”</p><p>The girl brought out our breakfast and retreated before anyone said anything. The doctor was indifferent to her, but the girl’s presence felt intrusive in our conversation. </p><p>“Start by eating, then tell me everything you know, and we’ll see from there.”</p><p>So I did—everything that I knew, from the faceless mask of my captor looming in the dark, to the cold metal of the blade at my neck. I told her about waking up in the snow, alone, freezing, my arm barely moving. About the storm. Faux. The gate.</p><p>My story must have been incoherent to her, yet she listened quietly the whole time, her face unchanging. I didn’t try to shape my story in any way, just the hard truth. </p><p>The room was quiet for a while after I finished, only the storm howling outside, it hadn’t settled yet. Doctor Oroya hadn’t touched her breakfast, but I was almost done by the time I finished recounting my tale. </p><p>I finished my meal and we sat there quietly for a while. She opened her mouth to speak a couple of times, but something stopped her. Eventually she settled on a question.</p><p>“Why you?”</p><p>“I’ve been asking myself that, this whole time. I told you everything I know. Where are we anyway? The Belt?”, </p><p>If I was a plant, I’d already know.</p><p>“Southeastern edge of the Belt,” she said finally. “At least two days from anything resembling civilization, even if you know where you’re going.” She paused, “Do you even have the money for it?”</p><p>I had no money, and no papers. I tried to jog my memory of the geography of the area. I’d need to take a boat around the Belt, since going through was not an option. The mountains were impossible to scale the closer you go to the centre of the Belt. And a boat was laughable in my current state, no papers, no stamp of approval. I was just another Marshin to them, I’d get whipped and sold off so fast I wouldn’t be able to say my name. </p><p>“No I don’t just keep money in my pockets while sleeping, don’t really expect kidnappers every night ya know?” I replied  dryly. </p><p>“Well, maybe you should”, she said with a faint smirk, the closest thing to a joke I’d hear from her. </p><p>I could tell she had more questions but she decided not to press on, but instead handed me a mop and told me to make myself useful. My back was hurting within minutes, and I was dragging more water around than I was cleaning up. We had servants for these sorts of things back home. </p><p>Eventually, with a sharp sigh and a muttered curse I didn’t catch, she snatched the mop out of my hands with more force than necessary and all but shoved me toward the hallway. I made my way back to the room she’d given me the night before, sat on the edge of the cot, and waited. When the storm cleared, Astaron would call for me. </p><p>The call came sooner than I expected. Faux was at the door, he’d brought some proper clothes. A thick, wool-lined coat in a deep slate gray, clearly made for someone broader than me, hung past my knees and made my arms look even thinner than they were. The sleeves swallowed my hands. The boots were sturdy leather, worn but warm, and rose halfway up my calves. They clunked awkwardly with each step, like a child playing dress-up in his father’s armor. I must’ve looked ridiculous, but I wasn’t about to complain. Warmth outweighed pride that afternoon.</p><p>I said my goodbyes to Doctor Oroya and thanked her in case I didn’t see her again, and we set off. The sky was bright that day, the clouds mostly dissipated. The narrow alley was a lot less sinister without the fog. We turned onto the main path, and I was able to take in the view of the surrounding mountains. Beyond the village, rising like twin monoliths, were two jagged peaks. The one to the left arched slightly inward near its summit, as though it had bent forward over centuries to whisper secrets to its smaller sister. The other rose straight and proud, its powerful face only broken by lines of stone. </p><p>Looking back down toward the gate, I saw the valley unfold in breathtaking silence. A vast, snowy basin stretched far below, flanked on both sides by towering ranges, their backs covered in brilliant white. Thousands of dark green pines clung to the slopes, the scale of it all made the village a speck in a grand painting. </p><p>“Listen, err, Rand’ar, ya gotta be real with Lord Astaron, he ain’t gonna believe yer expedition bullshit”, Faux said, his tone casual, but eyes sharp. “Man’s seen enough to see through your lies before ya breathe.  You try to spin him a tale, and he won’t call you out, he’ll just stop listenin’. And when that happens, yer gonna wish he <em>had</em> called you out.”</p><p>He adjusted the sheath on his belt. The hilt was a deep navy blue, wrapped tightly for grip, and capped with bronze fittings. I couldn’t help but wonder what he needed a sword for out here in the mountains. </p><p>He glanced once more at me, “Look you don’t gotta tell me what yer story is, and I don’t care to know it ‘less you want to tell it. But whatever you do, don’t insult his time.” </p><p>I wasn’t sure if he was trying to give me or he was serious, but I had decided to just tell Astaron the truth. </p><p>The path winded uphill as we went through the village, and began to widen fast. We came upon a grand set of stairs. Each step was carved from a dark stone. At the top, was another looming gate. The gate we had seen earlier paled in comparison. Its frame was built from veined marble, reinforced with metal bands. Massive, spiked hinges held two towering doors that looked like they could hold back armies.</p><p>Halfway up the staircase, nestled in a cutout in the stone, sat an immense boulder, rugged and gray. Dozens of swords had been driven into it, their hilts protruding like a forest of forgotten battles. It looked ceremonial or ritualistic in nature, each blade must’ve told a story. </p><p>The gate was left ajar, the keepers were expecting us. The sun blinded my eyes so I couldn’t see beyond the gap. I stepped through anyway</p><p><a id=\"_p1l0dl69rdpt\"></a></p><p><a id=\"_3ittdjorgu04\"></a></p>"

      "content": "<p>Divine, it must have been, for no man could have pictured such a place nestled deep in the mountains. Beyond the gate was a structure that defied simple classification, a castle—no—a temple, for it was regal. </p><p>The central courtyard stretched far and wide, paved with slate stones darkened by snowmelt. Two massive buildings flanked either side, mirror images of each other—long, formidable halls of dark stone and lacquered timber, their roofs pitched steeply against the snowfall. Tall windows lined their walls, most shuttered or barred, and banners of deep blue and bronze hung still in the thin mountain air. They bore the severity of a fortress with the elegance of a sanctuary. </p><p>Their architecture was tiered, rising in layers with ridged gables that flared outwards like the wings of a great beast. The roofs were layered with snow and the ice clung to the gable edges. Each drip had frozen mid-fall, forming long icicles that glittered in the pale light. </p><p>Wide wooden doors, reinforced with iron studs, were spaced at regular intervals along their length. The silence was serene, save for the faint rustle of banners that draped down along the walls, some of which had frozen mid-flutter in the mountain air. </p><p>Straight across the gate, on the far side of the intimidating courtyard was a tower that pierced the sky. The tower soared far above the rest of the keep, a six-sided colossus shaped unlike anything I’d ever seen. Each of its sides curved gently inward, giving the tower an imposing figure. It rose up, tier by tier, balconies on each level, railings decorated with ornamental patterns. Each level crowned with a wide, sweeping roof that curled at the edges, and snow blanketed each ledge. It didn’t look built, it looked conjured. </p><p>I assumed we would be meeting Lord Astaron in the great tower, but Faux turned left toward one of the vast halls that bordered the courtyard.</p><p>“The big man isn’t up there?” I asked Faux.</p><p>“Nah, he’s usually down here, with the men”, he replied without looking back.</p><p>“Are these some sort of training grounds?”, I asked.</p><p>“You could say that”, he said, not slowing his pace.</p><p>Before I could stop myself, I said, “You’re building an army here, aren’t you?”</p><p>He gave a faint smile, pausing for a moment, to spare a glance at me, “Sharp one, aren’t ya?”</p><p>Despite my peril, the situation was galvanizing, sparking something fierce within me. What a place I was in, tucked away in some corner of the world, shrouded by veils of snow, cradled by mountains. Each step forward strengthened me for the confrontation ahead. </p><p>Faux made his way to one of the wooden doors and slid it open with a single hand, the motion was fluid but noticeably one sided, betraying an injury in his other hand. We stepped inside and took off our boots. Immediately, I heard the shouting and holler of a fight.</p><p>“Every damn mornin’ with these idiots”, Faux muttered to himself, stomping towards the noise. </p><p>We turned into a large candle lit chamber, the noise swelling as the door creaked open. At its center lay a sunken dueling platform, circular, with two short steps leading down from the stone floor. The flickering candlelight cast long shadows across the walls, dancing over the eager faces of a dozen young men who stood around the edge, watching intently at the two dueling below.</p><p>A duel would be too dignified a word, for what unfolded before us was no such thing. This was a brawl in its rawest form, a one-sided thrashing paraded as sport. The stockier of the two boys was getting his arse handed to him. Yet it seemed like the onlookers were cheering for him, “<em>STUBBY, STUBBY</em>”, they chanted. </p><p>If they were naming them based on body type, then the other one should’ve been called ‘<em>Lithey</em>’ or maybe ‘<em>Spindle</em>’. He moved like a whip, and hit like one too. He dodged and weaved Stubby’s lethargic uncoordinated punches with graceful ease. I tried to squeeze between the other onlookers to get a better look, but they wouldn’t budge, so I stood on top of a nearby stool.</p><p>Stubby threw a wild punch at Spindle, putting all the force his squat little frame could muster, but Spindle was already out of reach, leaving him swinging mid air. Stubby was panting by then, already out of breath, but Swindle was just getting started. He ran at Stubby before he could get his breath back, closed the distance in a flush, ducking Stubby’s late swing, and slammed his shoulder into Stubby’s gut. The impact knocked the wind out of him, and before Stubby could react, Swindle had hooked a leg behind his knee and twisted. The larger boy toppled like a felled tree, crashing hard into the platform. The crowd was roaring by now.  </p><p>Faux finally stepped in, he must’ve been interested in the fight too, but it had gone too far, and the winner was evident. One moment Faux was standing next to me behind the rest of the crowd, and the next he was between Stubby and Swindle, tearing them apart. </p><p>“Do I gotta break up a new fight every goddamn day”, Faux roared. The crowd went silent, shrinking behind his anger. Stubby was slumped on one knee, clutching his side, while Swindle stood over him. “You all want Orem finding out? ‘Member what happened last week?”</p><p>“Wait Faux wait, it was just for fun, no one got hurt”, one of the other boys pleaded. Stubby shot him a glare, clutching his ribs.</p><p>“Besides, Stubby’s the one who started it, he was just frustrated after Orem put him outside for ‘missing a spot’ on the table. You know how Orem gets, he’s looking for a reason to keep us freezing,” some of them snickered at that, and Stubby shot him glares, but Faux was unimpressed. He walked over to the boy, and narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Oh? Then I’ll be sure to let Orem know you’ve got some things to say” Faux said coolly. “I’m sure he’d <em>love</em> to hear yer thoughts on his teaching.”</p><p>“I’m sorry sir”, the boy replied, terrified of whatever Orem might have in store. </p><p>Faux drew in a slow breath and faced the rest of the crowd. “You’re all brothers now, nothing can change that, you instigate Tommy here to fight, so that you can all have a laugh, but what do you think happens out on the field. They’ll cut ya down if you don't stand together like a pack. When one falls—”</p><p>He stepped forward, reached down, and hauled Stubby to his feet with one hand. The boy winced, but didn’t resist.</p><p>“When one falls,” Faux continued, his voice lowered, “you pick them up and get them to their feet, and ya get right back at the bastards who dropped them.”</p><p>He took another long pause before saying, “Better not see any more infighting after this.”</p><p>A silent weight fell over the room, whatever heat had been in the room moments ago had dissipated, replaced by a quiet understanding. No one dared to meet Faux’s gaze. It was not out of fear, but something close. The boys slowly filed out, drifting off to whatever duties or drills awaited them. </p><p>“Rand’ar, to me. Astaron’s waiting”, he said, arms crossed while leaning on the door. </p><p>We walked further down the hall and up two sets of stairs before we came across a wide, high-ceilinged chamber. The room was colder than the last, the walls of stone echoed the heavy movements. The floor was covered in thick, straw-colored mats, worn down from years of grinding feet and spilt blood. </p><p>A group of men, no older than their mid twenties, were spaced out in pairs, fencing with wooden swords. Their clothes were torn, smeared with dirt and dried blood, and fresh bruises blossomed across exposed skin. They circled around each other defensively, aiming to pierce their opponents guard, each swing deliberate and controlled. </p><p>There was no laughter here like the younger group. It was a grim sight, every man stood for power. Their movements were disciplined yet thoughtful. One man fell to his knees after a brutal hit to the ribs, his opponent didn’t hesitate and drove his sword into the fallen man’s guts. Two other men moved the unconscious body to the side without ceremony, leaving him slumped against the wall like a piece of broken gear.</p><p>At the front of the group stood a man older than the rest, older than Faux even, his stance and posture impeccable. A swordmaster, clearly, he spoke little, letting the rhythm of the routine guide the training. This wasn’t mild sparring, this was the training of an elite group of warriors. </p><p>“Is that Lord Astaron?” I asked Faux, nodding toward the swordmaster. His left sleeve betrayed that he had only one arm. I wondered how a man with one arm could become a swordmaster.</p><p>“No, that’s Hurbasa, the Sabelir. Astaron’s up there”, Faux said, gesturing toward a balcony that wrapped around the perimeter of the chamber. I followed his gaze.</p><p> Astaron stood in the centre of the balcony above. His robes were dark, a deep, saturated navy veined with threads of crimson. Though we were indoors, the robes were thick and heavy, lined with black fur around the collar and cuffs, a reminder of the mountain chill that surrounded us.</p><p>In his left hand, he held a long intricately crafted wooden staff, almost as tall as he was. He planted it firmly on the floor. not as a crutch, but perhaps a marker of presence. He didn’t lean on it, he didn’t need to. Unlike the sight below, his manner and clothing were pristine yet there was an undeniable weight to him. </p><p>I followed Faux up the steps, my heart was throbbing in my chest, each step reminding me of what awaited at the top. If I failed here, I’d be discarded like the unconscious man thrown to the side, except I’d be dead. Lord Astaron stood still and absolute, his focus on the chamber below. The staff at his side stood like a pillar, anchoring him to the ground. Two men flanked his sides.</p><p>“Rand’ar”, he said without turning back. “How has the Mountain been treating you?”</p><p>The question threw me off guard, I paused for a moment and looked at Faux, who simply nodded as if to say <em>yer gonna be fine kid.</em></p><p>“It’s cold, to say the least,” I replied, trying to keep my voice steady.</p><p>Astaron let out a low chuckle, still facing the training floor, “A fair answer. Nature is honest that way, it reveals its force without warning and without prejudice.”</p><p>He finally turned to face me, his face a mask of stone and reticence, “Faux informs me you spent nearly an hour in the storm, dressed for spring and lacking any form of protection, yet you survived. What a curious thing, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>Whatever form of ease he seemed to bring was gone in an instant, yet his expression did not betray anger, or even suspicion. His face—and voice, betrayed nothing, he was simply asking a question, and he expected a simple answer. But I did not have a simple answer, not then.</p><p>“I swear to you on everything I do not know. I don’t know how I got here, I was taken from my home in the dead of night. One instant I was asleep, the next I was being dragged out of my bed, something must’ve hit me—hard—and everything went black. </p><p>“When I woke up, I was lying in snow, in the middle of the storm, freezing, with nothing. I don’t know why they brought me here and I don’t know why they even did this. I just want to see my family again, I’ll forget I was ever here.”</p><p>“That’s not how this works boy,” he said evenly, voice as flat as his stony expression. “Deception won’t help you get back home. Tell me, <em>boy</em>,” he spat out, heavy with disdain. “By whose design were you sent here, and with what purpose?” </p><p>I tried to stammer out a response, but nothing came out. My judgement was clouded. All sense of confidence had vanished, my legs shook beneath me. The doctor had warned me—Faux too—what would happen if Lord Astaron was dissatisfied by my answer.</p><p>And so it had come, the drift of death, creeping into the edges of my thoughts. The walls, despite being so far apart, all closed in on me, and my head was on fire, possibilities going through my mind, things I could have done differently. </p><p>“I wasn’t sent, I was taken, I don’t even know where <em>here</em> is. And I don’t really care to find out” I uttered desperately.</p><p>“You don’t seem to understand, no one just strolls through here by accident. Never mind who sent you here. I will ask you only one more time, how did you find this place?”</p><p>My throat tightened, I had no reasonable answer to give, so I stayed silent. I was too far in to start spewing lies. </p><p>“Nothing to say? Fine, take him to the well,” he motioned to the two men on his sides. </p><p>Rough hands seized my arms. I struggled and flailed but could not loosen their grip. They simply picked me up from my arms and dragged me away. </p><p>I turned my head to get one last glimpse at Lord Astaron, “Silence will be your companion for the night—if you don’t freeze over first. We shall see when you’re ready to talk.”</p><p>I drove my feet into the ground to stop my jailers, but one of them dug the hilt of his sword into my head. A dull crack burst across my skull. My heels scraped across the rough floor, leaving streaks in the frost that clung to the floor. </p><p>They dragged me outside to the back of the building to an old stone well. The stones were etiolating, ice seeped into every crack. Cold rope bit into my wrists, tighter with every pull, until my fingers throbbed and went numb.</p><p>I thrashed violently to loosen the grip of the rope, but to no avail. The only thing I was met with was a fist to the gut, stealing the breath from my lungs.</p><p>“Let him learn silence down there,” one of them muttered, before shoving me forward toward the well. Before I knew it, I was pummeling down towards the dark pit at the bottom. I was weightless for a moment before the world slammed me down into the chilly stiff stone—no—ice. The water was frozen of course. </p><p>I looked up at the circle of light above. One of them peered down, laughed, then cut the rope. It fell in a heap at my feet. </p><p>I clawed at the stone wall, desperate to climb, but my hands found nothing. I slipped, cracked my head against the wall on the way down. Darkness swallowed me whole.</p><p>The cold gnawed at my throat, working its way into the confines of my insides. Each breath was a sharp knife to my nose, the air so sharp it hurt to see. The dull throb in my head made it hard to stay awake, I could feel myself slipping. The ropes only cut deeper into my wrists as I moved around. </p><p>Every part of me screamed to lie down, give in, and pray death came fast and swift.</p><p>But something deeper wouldn't let me.<em> Keep going, Rand'ar. You're a Marshin. There's still fight left in you.</em></p><p>I sat up slowly and felt along the stone wall until I found a sharp edge of rock.</p><p>Hours—or maybe just one—slipped by as I worked desperately, sawing at the rope against the edge of the stone, each movement cutting further into my wrists. The bindings cut into my wrists, leaving them raw and bleeding. But eventually, the rope fell away.</p><p>Later, something plopped onto my head. A bag. Inside: stale bread and gloves. I ate slowly, grateful for whoever had thrown it down. </p><p>The small act of kindness steeled me in that forsaken place, I was committed to seeing it through. I vowed to myself that if they did cut me down, I would stand valiant and proud. In that moment, I prepared myself for what was to come, I steadied my breath, quieted the tremble in my hands, and buried the fear deep where no one would see it. I put on my own mask of iron, I would <em>not</em> flinch at the first chance of death if it came. </p>"

      "content": "<p>I could not sleep that night. No, the cold and brittle dark hollowed me out. I sat up against the wall hugging my knees and could only think. Oh how I missed home, my family, in that wretched pit.</p><p>I sat in the darkness for hours. My mother used to sing about this—The Abyss—the endless dark that swallows desperate men clinging to death. I’d always thought it was just a story to scare children into behaving. Alone in that well, I almost wished it was real. At least floating through darkness would be better than that dilapidated well. </p><p>Every few hours, someone would throw down some food. Stale bread, hard cheese, dried meat, always accompanied with water. I would gulp it down before it ever reached the bottom it seemed, yet it was never enough. The hunger was unending, it was all that consumed my mind. </p><p>It must have been a full day before a rope was thrown down at me, and a deep gruff voice commanded me to <em>grab on</em>.</p><p>So I did. I wrapped my arms and legs around the rope and held on for dear life. The overwhelming light from the setting sky blinded me as I crested over the top. I toppled onto the floor and immediately a rag was put over my head, my wrists and ankles bound in chains, and I was picked up in one full swoop. </p><p>The cold wind bit at me as I was carried, far sharper than the damp chill of the dark well I’d spent the night in. The air grew denser, less biting, carrying the faint scent of wood and dry earth. I couldn’t see anything, yet every shift beneath my hands and feet told me we were moving into some sort of shelter.</p><p>I was roughly slammed down into the creaky wooden floor. My abductor pulled the rag off my head. Immediately the scent of blood hit me, it was smeared all over the walls. Around me, bulging sacks squirmed with flies, their incessant buzzing  filling the air with a maddening drone.</p><p>I forced my eyes to adjust to the dim light filtering through cracks in the walls. Shadows revealed shapes I couldn’t immediately identify; lumps beneath canvasses, presumably the bodies of the dead. Every instinct in me screamed that I was in terrible danger. </p><p>A large blocky square shouldered man towered above me. I assumed the figure must’ve been a man, the sheer bulk and height leaving little room for doubt. But as my eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, I saw the details more clearly. The dark long braided hair falling over the shoulders and spilling down her back, the sharpness of her cheekbones catching a stray beam of light, the curve of her frame beneath the rough furs she wore. Praise the Light! This was no man, although she was definitely bigger and taller than any man I’d ever seen. </p><p>She squatted down to bring her head down to my level. I writhed under the heavy chains. Her rough callused hands grabbed a fistful of my hair and she yanked up, jolting me alert. </p><p>In a deep, almost masculine voice, she said “The lord has hope for you yet, he thinks you’ll come round. I don’t have his patience, nor his generosity.”</p><p>The words cut through the haze in my mind. <em>The lord</em>, did she mean Astaron? </p><p>She pulled my head further up, sparks of pain went through my scalp down my spine. </p><p>“Let’s see if you’ll adhere to your silence now. You’ve had time to decide what matters are more important to you, the secrets you hide, or the little fingers in your hands.” </p><p>She ran the back of her other hand over my face, her fingers inspecting my cheek down to my chin, then tapping against my jaw as if checking for weakness.</p><p>“What are you doing?” I asked.</p><p>“Seeing how easily you’ll break,” she said.</p><p>“You’ll find I’m harder to snap than you think.”</p><p>A ghost of a smile flickered on her face, illuminated by a sliver of light passing through a crack in the walls. “Brave words for a boy in chains. You’re no different from the rest, rats squeal the same in the end.”</p><p>I forced my voice steady, “Then you haven’t listened closely enough. I don’t squeal.”</p><p>Her nails pressed into my throat now, not enough to choke, but enough to remind me how easy it would be. “You think defiance makes you strong? It only makes you bleed longer.”</p><p>She continued, “Child, I don’t think you understand the severity of your situation. I’ve been given free reign to do whatever I need to do, to get answers out of you. Or perhaps... to see what you're truly capable of when pushed.\"</p><p>“I can feel your heart pounding in your chest, boy. I will ask you once. On whose orders are you here?”</p><p>“I don’t know! Someone grabbed me in Nothello—I never saw their face. I woke up here. That’s all I know.”</p><p>Then her fist shot forward.</p><p>The impact was like being hit with a cannon, my chest caved in under the sheer force, and the chains rattled violently as I was thrown into the wall. A sickening crack tore through my body, a flash of white hot pain bore my eyes. </p><p>A scream tore out of me, raw and beastly, reverberating against the chamber walls until it dissolved into hoarse gasps. </p><p>A wicked laugh spewed from her throat, animalistic and wild. She had broken my damned ribs. And she was laughing. The pain was excruciating, every breath I took brought me closer to passing out. I took short quick gulps of air to try and steady myself. I could feel my bones moving around inside me, it was intolerable. I hunched forward as far as the chains would allow, desperate to cradle the wound, but her grip on my hair wrenched me upright again.</p><p>“Do you hear yourself? Every scream, every gasp you choke out . . .  it thrills me. Good, good, so now we both understand where this goes unless you start babbling. I won’t ask twice,” her voice went from wild laughter to total sobriety uncomfortably fast. </p><p>“Who holds your leash?” she pulled on my chains as if to say she held the leash now.</p><p>“I’m not a mutt like you, <em>Marshin</em>” I spat out that last word like it was the most vile insult, as if I wasn’t a Marshin myself. And that riled her up, she pulled the chains on my arms and shook them violently. The dull ache worsened with each vicious manoeuvre. </p><p>It went on for a while like that, she would ask the same questions again, <em>who do you work for? How did you get here? </em>My unsatisfactory answers would provoke another bout of shaking. She never threw another hit like that first one again, perhaps fearing I’d simply roll over and expire. </p><p>Eventually I passed out, and the horrid woman must have left. In small bouts of consciousness, I saw—felt—someone working on me. A man, although I could never be sure, moved like a shadow, silently. He never made a sound, he simply worked. Coarse cloth wrapped around my chest, pulled tight until every shift of my ribs screamed. He did not have the tender touch that Doctor Oroya had. His hands were rough, yet meticulous. </p><p>As he wrapped my ribs with mechanical precision, he muttered under his breath—not to me, but to himself: \"Subject remains unresponsive. No manifestation. Continue observation.\" Subject? I was too delirious to even process what that meant.</p><p>Whatever it was, his labour was not out of mercy like the good doctor, but out of duty to keep me alive. I expected there would be more rounds of questioning. </p><p>And those rounds came, they were careful to let my ribs heal, but there was no mercy for my fingers, legs, and other extremities. They simply left me tied to a wall in that box with its revolting smell of bodies. My own blood had left stains, on my clothes, the floor, the chains. And every time, the same man would come and fix me up, make me presentable for another round of torment.</p><p>They ripped my fingernails apart, cut me open and crudely stitched me back together. Some days, they would go easy on me by resorting to a simple beating. All the while asking the same question, <em>who do you serve?</em> </p><p>It was utterly despicable. I had simply been a child, yet no mercy had been spared. In those moments, the dread and hate for my own people heightened. My parents were right to leave those wretched people, I thought. What terrible fate brought me back to them, I wondered. </p><p>I thought back to the stories and history my parents taught, the Sargaryn greed and the oppression the Marshin faced. I saw none of that as I lay clutching countless bruises in that damned box. I saw only beasts dressed in the skin of men.</p><p>Somehow, my bones healed fast, within a week. The stoic man who had bandaged me had a look of surprise when he came to check on the bandages. </p><p>The large woman who had broken my ribs had returned, but her demeanor had shifted. The wild cruelty was gone, replaced by something clinical. She studied me like a physician studies a patient, looking for symptoms that refused to appear.</p><p>She came with a new method. She had brought a bucket with her, filled to the brim with a dark squirming liquid. The metallic tang hit me before I saw it. I barely had time to inhale before she yanked my hair and plunged my face into the thick, cold liquid. My mind shut down all thoughts except for the desperate clinging exigency for oxygen. When I thought I could take it no more, a sharp tug pulled me out. The taste of iron engulfed my other senses. Through the thick red liquid, I looked into the bucket and finally realized what it was. Blood. Puke littered my clothes, I could not stop myself. </p><p>“Barbarians. You’re all barbarians”, I spewed out. I should not have spoken, I had accidentally swallowed the vile liquid.</p><p>“Child, you’ve been at this for a week. Still nothing? Lord Astaron will be disappointed.”</p><p>She didn’t even acknowledge what I said, she cleaned her hands with a towel and simply left. What the hell did they want from me? At that point, it was all for sport. Why didn’t they just kill me? Even if I was a rat, how much danger could I bring to them? They were exacting their desperate revenge on a boy, barely fifteen.</p><p>The bucket of blood had left me sick. The metallic tang lingered in my mouth, and every small sound set my nerves on edge. </p><p>By the third day, the nausea had begun to ebb, leaving me drained and starving. Every nibble of food they had given me had come back out. I was no longer chained to the wall, but still locked inside the chamber. I could move around, but preferred to stay in the same corner, the unending stench of bodies straggled everywhere else, bringing about more bouts of gagging. </p><p>They left me alone for a few days after that. Someone would drop off some food, but when they realized I stopped eating that too, they force fed me, shoving down every morsel of dried meat down my throat. </p><p>The door to the shed swung wide open, the light of a new day peered down on my face.</p><p>“Get up!” someone shouted in a gruff voice. I recognized the voice, it was Faux. The same Faux that had inadvertently sentenced me to weeks of agony by <em>‘saving’</em> me. </p><p>I heard his footsteps before I saw him. “I said, get up!” He repeated.</p><p>The man cursed under his breath, but then halted when he finally noticed me. My tattered hair, the dirt, grime and blood spread all over my clothes and body. The bruises from lashes and lacerations that had left my body purple. </p><p>His jaw tightened, “My god…” he muttered to himself.</p><p>He crouched down, no longer barking orders, but studying me like I was some ruined creature he’d stumbled across by accident. He cleared his throat and spoke again, softer this time, though the gruffness lingered out of habit.</p><p>“How’re you ...” he started. “How’re ya even alive?”</p><p>I stared at him blankly, tilting my head. My lips parted, but no sound came out. My throat was too raw to speak.</p><p>Faux shook his head. “They shouldn’ta done this. Not to you. Not like this.” He muttered a curse under his breath. “Damn Astaron, damn that Yaḍeha. You’re barely more than a boy.”</p><p>I drank the water, but it only burned my throat. </p><p>“You’ve survived longer than anyone thought possible. That’s something. That means something,” he muttered to himself.</p><p>I coughed, the sound hollow and weak. “Means … what?”</p><p>Faux leaned in closer, his voice almost a whisper now, as if he didn’t want anyone outside to hear. “It means yer stronger than them. Stronger than the ones who tried to break you. You’re … meant for more than… than this!” he pointed his hands out at me, conflicted in his thoughts.</p><p>“... more?” I asked.</p><p>His lips pressed into a thin line, and he looked away for a moment before meeting my eyes again. “Astaron was wrong about ya. Wrong to bring you here like this, wrong about what you are.”</p><p>“So what, you here to save me now? Didn’t work out so well last time, did it?” My voice was coming back to me then, hoarse and brittle. </p><p>Faux flinched like I’d hit him with a battering ram. For a long moment, he said nothing. Then he slowly reached into his belt. I tensed, expecting another lash, but instead he pulled out a small iron key.</p><p>“No,” he began. “Not to save you. I already failed at that. But to help ya.” He undid my chains and held out his hands to help me up.</p><p>For the first time in weeks, I could move my arms properly. I tried to bring my arms to my face, to feel the horrors they’d done to me. I tried to stand, but my legs had become frail, I stumbled but Faux caught me.</p><p>“Easy,” he said. “Come on. There’s water, clean water. I’ll get ya to it.”</p><p>I tripped as I tried to walk. Faux tightened his grip, surprisingly patient. </p><p>“You don’t got to trust me,” he murmured as he half-dragged, half-carried me toward the door. “Not yet. But let me do this much.”</p><p>I wanted to spit out some bitter reply, but my voice failed me. All I could manage was a ragged breath. </p><p>The door groaned open. Light spilled in, blinding after weeks in the dark. Faux stepped forward, and I let him carry me.</p><p>One step. Then another.</p>"

      "content": "<p>I tried to scrub the scars away. The lashes and contusions, but they would not go. They never would, even when they eventually faded away over years, those wounds stayed with me.</p><p>It took copious amounts of effort to scrub away the dried blood and grim that clung to my skin. Even the scented soap burned against the raw patches and wounds, sending sharp jolts of pain down my body. </p><p>Faux had helped me to a small room devoid of any windows, furniture or adornments. Yet still, it was a vast improvement from the repulsive chamber I had spent the weeks before in. Only a bucket of warm water, and a small bar of soap filled the room.</p><p>I dipped my hands into the water, and held them up to my eyes. The skin was mottled with deep purples and angry reds, cuts crisscrossing my knuckles. I recoiled at the horrid sight. These couldn’t be my hands.</p><p>The water rippled. My reflection fractured.</p><p>Then—</p><p>I was falling.</p><p>Not the water. Not the room. Just me. I was falling.</p><p>You know that feeling. That jolt when you're drifting off to sleep and suddenly your body thinks you've slipped off of a ledge. Your limbs spasm, stomach lurches, and for one terrible instant you're certain you're plummeting, before you slam back into your bed, heart racing, sheets twisted around you.</p><p>Now imagine that feeling never stops.</p><p>I fell through nothing. Through black that had weight and texture, thick as oil, cold as the void between stars. My body tumbled, or perhaps it didn't move at all and the darkness simply poured past me. I couldn't tell. There was no up or down, no sense of direction, only the endless, nauseating drop.</p><p>My stomach stayed lodged in my throat. That lurch, that sickening moment of freefall—it stretched on and on, every second an eternity of the same horrible instant. I tried to scream but I had no mouth. Tried to flail but my limbs did not move, phantoms I couldn't quite remember how to control.</p><p>The darkness had a sound. A low hum, barely perceptible, like the ringing after a bell has stopped—that lingering vibration that makes your teeth ache. It burrowed into my skull, resonating in the hollows of my bones.</p><p>I was aware, horribly aware, of myself dissolving. Not dying—that would have been mercy. Unraveling. The edges of my consciousness frayed like rotted rope. Memories surfaced and sank: my mother's face, already fading at the edges; the pink tree in moonlight, its blossoms turning to ash; Minarra's laugh, distorting into something alien and cruel.</p><p>And I kept falling.</p><p>Time had no meaning here. Was it seconds? Hours? Years? I was falling before I was born and would be falling after I died. The fall was all there ever was or would be. The Abyss, it didn't kill you—it convinced you that you were already dead, had always been dead, that life was the dream and this endless drop was the only reality.</p><p>I tried to hold onto something—anything. My name. But what was a name? Just sounds. Rand'ar. The syllables scattered like dust. My father's face—gone. My home—a concept that had no meaning. There was only falling, and the certainty that I deserved this fall, that I had been falling my entire life and only now realized it.</p><p>The darkness began to whisper. Not in words—words would have been a comfort. These were pre-verbal things, thoughts that bypassed language entirely and planted themselves directly in the meat of my mind.</p><p>Something grabbed me.</p><p>Rough hands that felt solid and real and hurt, and that hurt was the most beautiful thing I'd ever felt because pain meant I had a body, meant I existed somewhere outside this void.</p><p>The darkness screamed. I felt it rip at me, trying to drag me back down, trying to convince me the hands were just another layer of the dream. But they held fast. They pulled.</p><p>And I surfaced. Gasping, retching, slammed back into a body that felt foreign and broken. Something felt different. Wrong. The room's edges seemed sharper than they should be, colors bled into each other in ways that made my eyes ache. I could hear Faux's heartbeat—no, that was impossible, I was imagining it. The exhaustion, the trauma, it made me see things that weren't there.</p><p>The small room. The bucket. The stone floor cold against my knees. Blood dripping down somewhere. I blinked hard, trying to clear my vision, but the strangeness lingered at the periphery—like watching the world through heavy fog.</p><p>“Praise the Light! What’s happenin’ to ya!” Faux’s voice boomed. His words sounded distant and muffled, but with his chest heaving, it was clear he was shouting. He grabbed me and hugged me tight, desperate to not let me continue my self-induced torment. </p><p>He shook me once, twice, as if he could jar me back into myself. “Damn it”, he muttered, low and ragged, the curse meant more for the room than for me.</p><p>“Yer eyes…” he started, then stopped. He shook his head, “Never mind, you’re back now.” </p><p>“What happened to ya?” Faux said, quieter now, almost a whisper.</p><p>The words would not come out of my mouth, I could not scream like I wanted to at that moment. So I clung to Faux tighter and let the tears flow like the blood that dripped down my head. </p><p>It was the first time I had cried since this nightmare had begun. Through the well, through the hunger, through the broken ribs, through the blood, through it all. I’d endured. </p><p>And in that moment, something stirred. For the first time in my entire life, I felt alive and there in the moment, like I had simply been coasting along all this while. The pain, the shame, the fear, the hunger—all of it was proof that I was really alive, that I was human.</p><p>“Easy now…” Faux’s voice wavered as though the words had turned brittle in his throat. His grip on my shoulder tightened, not to comfort, but to steady himself. “Don’t… don’t try to speak of it. Best not.”</p><p>He swallowed hard, eyes flicking to the shadows as though something might be listening.</p><p>I buried my face against him, his thick wool coat nudging against me. I breathed rapidly, trying to calm myself, feeling the sensations of my hands, making sure I truly had command of myself. </p><p>“Let me get you some clothes—and somethin’ to dry up with,” he said.</p><p>In that raw moment, I knew with a desperate, aching certainty—I wanted to live.</p><p>I dried off and put on the fresh clothes Faux provided me. They fit me better than the last pair of clothes Faux had provided me with, the ones I had endured in for weeks. They were unremarkable, yet putting them on felt like a small sense of order returning.</p><p>I caught my reflection in a scrap of polished metal hanging on the wall for just a moment. My eyes, they looked … wrong. The colour looked off. I couldn’t tell what it was exactly. I blinked and they were normal again. Just exhaustion. </p><p>“Where are we going?” I asked Faux as we walked through winding halls littered with rooms on either side. </p><p>“Astaron wants to see ya,” he replied.</p><p>I ground my teeth. “He couldn’t come down to the shit hole himself? Sends you instead?” </p><p>Faux kept his eyes ahead, defeated. </p><p>“Never said I agreed with him,” Faux said, his eyes narrowing. “I’m only tellin’ ya what he thinks. Got you out of that hellhole so ya could hear it straight from him.” He paused, stepping closer. “Look, I ain’t sure what he’s gonna say to ya, but if he gives you an offer, just take it, ‘kay?”</p><p>“What’s he going to offer?” I asked meekly.</p><p>“Not sure, he didn’t say. But it’s better than that shit box, right?”</p><p>“Sure,” I narrowed my eyes. “Just take me to Astaron,” </p><p>Faux gave a stiff nod, saying nothing more. He finally turned and led me to the sliding wooden door that opened up to the exterior facade. An outdoor balcony made of rippled stone that overlooked the vast courtyard below. </p><p>The air outside slapped me raw, ever the reminder of the Belt’s unrelenting climate. I hunched into myself as he tossed my coat into my hands. I pulled it over my shoulders, the silence between us as thick as the frost that clung to the tiered roofs of the great tower. </p><p>On the far edge of the balcony was a simple wooden bench, its back draped in snow. And there he sat—Lord Astaron. His ever-watchful staff was propped diagonally across him: the base nestled under his left boot, while the long shaft leaned against the curve of his right thigh. Even at rest it was poised for command. </p><p>My eyes were drawn to it, its elaborate design. The staff was designed like a pillar, split into two distinct halves by a polished bronze that gleamed in the sunlight. </p><p>The upper half was carved with intricate patterns, arched crescents and full discs, etched to depict the twin moons and their constant battle in the night sky. The lower half stood in radiant contrast to the depiction above. Where the upper half whispered of night, this part blazed with the mark of day. Etched into the wood were flaring sunbursts, flaring arcs and jagged lines representing solar flares. I wondered what the depictions meant, perhaps balance or harmony of the celestial bodies. </p><p>His face was shadowed by a round iron hat that sat on his head. It too had engravings depicting the celestial bodies in our sky. The twin moons carved in their fleeting dance, orbiting around the eternal sun.</p><p>“Sit, Rand’ar,” Astaron said as I neared him, patting the empty space beside him on the bench.</p><p>“I prefer to stand, <em>Lord,</em>” I said with venom in my voice. </p><p>“Suit yourself,” He finally looked up at me. His old and tired face was worn down from the decades. I wanted to strike him there and then. To make him feel an ounce of the pain I had felt. I doubted my hand would make it anywhere near his face, he may have been old, but he had the look of a true warrior.</p><p>“Rand’ar, you’ve put me in a troubling situation. On one hand, I’ve got a northern spy scouting my lands, his masters itching to butcher us. On the other hand, the spy is just a kid who should never have survived a night in the Belt.” He leaned forward, “So I had to be certain. Certain you weren't a plant. And certain you weren't... something else. My people have methods for both.\"</p><p>He studied me. \"You survived them. That tells me what I needed to know.\"</p><p>“I’m no spy,” I spat.</p><p>Astaron gave a faint, knowing smile. “No? Yet here you are with no trail, no gear, no plausible tale. Where are your kidnappers then? You insult me with half-truths, boy, but I’ll give you this, you’ve got a stubborn fire in you.” </p><p>He continued, “What do you think it is we do here?”</p><p>“Teach men how to starve and freeze.”, I replied.</p><p>“Don’t play the fool with me boy, you know better than that.”</p><p>I mulled it over for a moment. “You’re leading a rebellion. Trying to bring back the Marshin glory days?”</p><p>“What do you know of history, Northerner? My people have suffered for millennia. For their prophecies, they butcher us and call it a mercy. We—”</p><p>“I’m not a Northerner,” I blurted, sharper than I meant. His gaze snapped to mine, cold and appraising. “I’m a Marshin. My parents left the southern continent before I was born. But I’m Marshin through and through.”</p><p>His brow furrowed, “What’s your full name, then, boy?”</p><p>“Rand’ar Torin Haestus.” Rand’ar, son of Haestus.</p><p>The staff clattered against the stone. For a moment—just one—I saw the mask crack. His face didn't twist with rage. It went slack, like I'd struck him.</p><p>“Say that again.”</p><p>\"Haestus was my father. He's dead now.\" I kept my voice flat, watching him carefully, “Did you know of him?”</p><p>Astaron's hand found the staff again. His knuckles went white. \"Haestus had no son.\"</p><p>“He had two, and two daughters. He left here for North before any of us were born.\"</p><p>\"He left.\" The words came out strangled. \"Yes. He did.\"</p><p>Astaron turned his back to me, staring out over the courtyard. When he spoke again, his voice had gone hollow. \"Haestus was the greatest man I ever knew. He orchestrated The Withdrawal—freed our people from chains that had held us for over a millennium. We thought we'd won.\"</p><p>He laughed, but there was no humor in it. \"We threw celebrations. We crowned our own kings. We believed the lie.\" He turned back to face me, and for the first time I saw something besides cold calculation in his eyes. It was grief. \"And Haestus... he saw it first. Before any of us. That we'd traded iron chains for invisible ones. That our kings answered to theirs. That freedom was just a word they let us have because it cost them nothing.\"</p><p>\"So he left,\" I said quietly.</p><p>\"So he left.\" Astaron's grip tightened on his staff. \"The man who'd given everything, his youth, his blood, his certainty—he just walked away. Left a letter saying he couldn't watch us celebrate a defeat dressed as victory. That he was done with grand causes and empty triumphs.\" His voice dropped to almost a whisper. \"That he wanted something real. Something that mattered.\"</p><p>The wind howled through the courtyard. Inside, the sounds of training continued.</p><p>\"We called him a coward,\" Astaron continued. \"A traitor. Some said he'd lost his nerve. Others said he'd gone mad.\" He studied me with those hard eyes. \"But he just saw the truth before the rest of us could bear to. That we'd have to burn it all down and start again. That The Withdrawal wasn't the end—it was just clearing away the old lie to reveal the deeper one.\"</p><p>\"And you stayed,\" I said.</p><p>\"I stayed. Because someone has to finish what he started. Someone has to win the war he realized we'd never stopped fighting.\" He planted his staff between us. \"So tell me, son of Haestus. Did he ever speak of us? Of the cause he abandoned? Or did he find his 'something real' and forget we still bleed down here?\"</p><p>The question was like a knife to my gut, and he knew it.</p><p>\"He never talked about the rebellion,\" I admitted. \"Never talked about the south at all. He just... trained me with a sword every night and told me to be stronger than he was.\"</p><p>Astaron's expression shifted—I couldn't read it. Satisfaction? Vindication? Disappointment?</p><p>\"Stronger than he was,\" he repeated. \"And are you, boy? Are you strong enough to finish what your father couldn't? To see the hard truth and not run from it?\"</p><p>\"I don't know what you're asking me.\"</p><p>\"I'm asking if you're your father's son—the man who won a false victory then fled—or if you're something else. Something that can endure what comes next.\" He leaned forward. \"What do you know about The Withdrawal, son of Haestus?\"</p><p>I steadied myself, trying to grasp where this was leading. \"What do I know, you ask? Let's see. The Sargaryn slaveowners left with their tall chains. We gained our freedoms for the first time and—\"</p><p>\"Wrong and wrong. We have never been more powerless as a people. Have you seen the state of these lands? The kings we bow to are not our kings. No, they are planted by foreign hands, puppets dressed in stolen crowns. We hold no lands, no coin, no voice. Our farmers still till soil that isn't theirs, our smiths forge the irons that chain us, and our sons bleed for banners that rule us. Our daughters still bartered off like cattle.”</p><p>“They dangled the keys to power in front of the few chosen Marshin, and they snatched it like starving dogs. Now they wear fine robes, take pleasure in the finer luxuries and believe themselves to be lords, but they are nothing more than servants, slaves made overseers. They've turned the same chains that held them, toward us. It is all a facade.”</p><p>“And the Sargaryn? They sit back in their high city, laughing as their work is done for them. So no, the slaveowners did not leave, they only changed their positions.\"</p><p>\"Why are you telling me all this?\" I asked.</p><p>\"If you are going to betray your own people, you should know the truth.\"</p><p>“I don't care about the truth. You tortured me. Why should I care what happens to any of you?\"</p><p>\"Careful, boy,\" he growled. \"You think you've seen hardship? You've never seen a girl of six so starved that her body contorts in on itself. And the parents of that child, they don't have a chance to worry since they have to work in endless labor to keep their family alive for another day. No, you've lived a comfortable life.\"</p><p>\"Comfortable? We may have had food on our table every night, but every time we left the house it was a danger. Up North, Marshin don't get to live. If anyone ever found out who we were, we'd be hunted to death, all for sport. I was never allowed to get close with anyone, make any friends, for fear of them finding out.\"</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \"You had choices. You had food, shelter, blood to claim you. My people have none of that. We are bred into bondage, with no hope for a better life.\"</p><p>\"I won't feel guilty for being born into a better life, that's not my choice. But you had a choice, a choice to hear me out, but you just locked me up in a box.\"</p><p>\"Isn't it strange, Rand'ar? That in a world so tightly controlled, you found your way to the one place where your kind still resists. Some would call it fate. Others,\" he glanced at me, \"might call it obligation.\"</p><p>\"You think you can turn me into your agent? You still think that I work for them?” I came closer and whispered, “Let me tell you some good news then. I don't have a secret button to call in the cavalry. There is no one coming to destroy you. Just let me go back home.\"</p><p>\"You survived the storm. Alone. With nothing. And you came to us from the north, unmarked, untracked. Tell me, Rand'ar... does that not strike you as strange?\" he asked.</p><p>I didn't answer. I couldn't. The fire in his words had quieted, but it left behind a pressure. I wasn't sure if his question was accusatory or not.</p><p>\"It does,\" I hesitated. \"Which is all the more reason I have to go back home. The longer I stay, the harder it'll be to explain any of this.\"</p><p>Astaron studied me, unmoved. \"Perhaps. But how will you cross the border? You'll need to ID yourself.\"</p><p>He tilted his head slightly, his voice controlled, \"You think the border guards will just wave you through? You have no identification. No name in their books. As far as they're concerned, you don't exist. You're just a runaway slave to them.\"</p><p>I wrapped the coat tighter around myself.</p><p>\"Yes I don't have my papers,\" I said. \"But I'll wait at the border if I have to—until the registry ships them back to me. I'm sure they'll find my records eventually. I'm not some ghost.\"</p><p>\"Rand'ar, I don't want to put you back in a cell. I really don't. I didn't enjoy any of this. I do what I must to ensure the safety of my people. And right now, you are a liability, left unchecked, who knows what trouble comes knocking.\" He shook his head, unwavering in his decision. \"I can't let you leave, not yet, but eventually. The circumstances of your arrival are too anomalous. I am giving you an opportunity here,\" he paused, spreading his arms, as if he was offering me paradise, but it was only darkness ahead.</p><p>\"So you'll keep me prisoner, until you decide what to do with me.\"</p><p>\"Not prisoner,\" he said, with an almost patronizing sadness. \"You'll be watched, yes. You'll earn our trust—or not. But you will be fed, clothed and sheltered and treated just like any other student. It's better than the alternative, we both don't want to see you back in that cell.\"</p><p>He let the weight of his words hang in the punishing air for a moment. His threat—no—his promise hung between us.</p><p>\"Speak plainly, what are you saying?\" I spat. I already knew what he was going to say, the offer Faux had mentioned.</p><p>He stood up, with an outstretched hand. \"Your father abandoned our people.”</p><p>His eyes lingered on my face for a moment—no—my eyes. He looked deep in them, searching for something. The silence stretched for an uncomfortable moment and I looked away, not before I caught something in his expression. Disappointment? No, that didn't make sense. He barely knew me.</p><p> “You can either follow his path or forge your own. Join me Rand'ar,” he began. I could have sworn his voice carried less conviction than before, “let us topple the Citadel of Sorrows and liberate our people.\"</p>"

      "title": "Chapter 7",
      "content": "<p>I scoffed at the thought, he wanted me to give up my life and dreams for a pointless pursuit. What could I say to that? I had no choice, he would not let me go to the border, not yet. </p><p>I could try to run now. It was just me and the old man Astaron, no one was in the courtyard below. The gate was open when we had first come through, would it still be? Could I make it to the outer wall before they caught me? And then what? Two days through the Belt with no supplies, no papers, no way to cross the border without being sold off.</p><p>I wondered just briefly what refusal would bring me, what dark bloody end I’d meet. The men here didn’t seem to forgive hesitation, and Astaron didn’t strike me as a man who repeated his offers. If I said no, I doubted I’d be shown the door. No, I’d simply vanish in one of these cold halls and never walk out again, only death to greet me on the far end. Whatever end I would meet would no doubt be worse than the shed. The promises of safety and shelter were only under the guise of obedience.</p><p>But it wasn't fear that stopped me from running. Not entirely.</p><p><em>Your father abandoned our people</em>, Astaron had said. The words circled back through my mind, sharp and insistent. My father, Haestus, had been more than just the man who trained me in our courtyard at night. He'd been a legend here. The architect of The Withdrawal. Their greatest hope, who'd walked away when they needed him most.</p><p>And I knew nothing about it. Nothing about why he’d led them, how he did it, or why he left. What made him choose his exile over glory? The man who'd taught me to be strong had carried a history I'd never questioned, never even known to ask about. I had that chance then, to find out the truth of his past. I don’t know how fate had spun its gears to bring me to that place, but I had to find out more about father.</p><p>What kind of son goes home without understanding who his father was?</p><p>I thought of returning to my family—walking through our door, sitting beneath the pink tree with Minarra, pretending everything was normal. But how could I sit there knowing I'd been within reach of the truth and turned away? How could I face my aunt's questions about where I'd been, knowing I'd fled before learning what my father had started, what he'd abandoned, whether he'd been a hero or a coward?</p><p>The shame of it twisted in my gut. Not shame at being tortured—no one could fault me for that. Shame at the ignorance. At living fifteen years as Haestus's son without understanding what that name meant to anyone but us.</p><p>And beneath that shame, something else stirred. Something that I didn’t want to name because it felt like betraying everything they’d done to me. Curiosity. Not about Marshin culture in some abstract sense. I had no love for these people—not after what they’d put me through. But I needed to understand what my father had seen in them. What cause had been worth leading, then worth abandoning. Whether the man who'd raised me had been running toward something real in the North, or just running.</p><p>“I don’t see how I have a choice.” I finally said. </p><p>But even as the words left my mouth, I knew they were a lie. I did have a choice. I could run, could take my chances with the cold and the border guards and the long journey home. I could return to my family and spend the rest of my life wondering.</p><p>Or I could stay. Not for Astaron or his rebellion. Not for some grand cause I couldn’t care to believe in. I’d stay for myself, because I couldn't leave without answers. Because somewhere in this frozen fortress was the truth about the man who'd shaped me, and I would not go home ignorant of it. And I still needed to find out who’d brought me here. I suspected my answer was closer than I thought.</p><p>So I would earn his trust, learn his teachings, and find my own way out of that place—or so I told myself. The truth, which I couldn't yet admit, was that I wanted to stay. I needed answers more than I needed freedom. But I wrapped that need in the language of strategy, of patience, of eventual escape. It made the choice easier to live with.</p><p>“My father,” I began. “You said you knew him, worked with him. I want to know what he was really like. Why he left. What he did here.\"</p><p>Astaron's expression didn't change, but something flickered in his eyes. </p><p>“Haestus was a complicated man, but an honorable one. There is much I could tell you about him, much you deserve to know.”</p><p>“But\" Astaron continued, his voice measured, \"such knowledge is not given freely. Your father earned his place in our history through action, through sacrifice, through achievement.\" He paused, letting the words settle. \"Achieve greatness on the battlefield and for our cause, and I will tell you more about him. Prove yourself worthy of his legacy.”</p><p>He wanted to use me as just another one of his puppets. So I’d play along, <em>achieve greatness</em> as he’d said. He dangled answers I desperately wanted just out of reach—making me perform for them. But it didn’t matter, I needed those answers more than I needed my pride.</p><p>“I will watch your journey with great curiosity, Rand'ar. I do hope you are better than your father.” He said, a twinkle in his eye. </p><p>That day, beneath frostbitten skies and foreign stone, I made the first of many decisions that cannot be undone. Astaron turned, his robes catching the wind, and beckoned me back inside. I followed him and we found Faux, ever the watchful, leaning on a wall. </p><p>“So, we tossing him to the wolves? Or is he staying?” Faux laughed.</p><p>“Get him a bunk, he trains with the others starting tomorrow,” Astaron replied. He whispered something quickly into Faux’s ear, to which he nodded. </p><p>Faux stood up to his full imposing height, and grinning ear to ear, said “Welcome to The Gauntlet, kid.”</p><p>Faux put on his boots and motioned me to follow him outside. We walked outside toward the large building on the opposite end of the courtyard. The cold had worsened now as the sun set into the peaks. The courtyard felt larger than ever with the wind cutting at my face. How would I survive this damned bitter cold, I thought as we walked. </p><p>“So,” Faux began, I was struggling to keep up with his tall stride. “How’d you convince the old man to not put ya in a cell?”</p><p>“I didn’t,” I replied. The truth was, I wasn’t sure why Astaron decided to let me walk free. He expected something from me, that much was clear, but what exactly, I couldn’t say.</p><p>“Worked some magic on him, did ya? Hiding somethin’ behind those eyes of yers?” He sneered.</p><p>“Sure, also enchanted him to give me the room at the top of the big tower.” I replied flatly.</p><p>Faux chuckled at that, shaking his head. “Believe me, ya don’t wanna be up there, way colder than it is down ‘ere.” He shivered at the thought.</p><p>We reached the far end of the courtyard. From outside, this building looked like a mirror image of the one we’d first emerged from. The ridged gables hung expansively above me. The black stone and deep wood of the walls were a respite from the howling winds. Lanterns hung on the walls, their glass panes fogged, casting a warm golden hue across the stone. The light within flickered, dancing along the grain of timber frames and catching on the thin layer of frost hugging the ledges. A pair of wide double doors loomed ahead, their surface weathered and frayed. Faux motioned me to slip it open, so I did and allowed Faux to go in first.</p><p>If I stepped in, I would be a part of these people, a cog in the machine. If someone betrayed this place, we’d all be killed, butchered, never to be heard of again. The Sargaryn aristocrats would scour the earth to find us, to snuff out any flames of rebellion, for Marshin are lesser than humans. If I died here, I’d never train Minarra<strong> </strong>again, never watch her grin after a good parry or her scowl when I corrected her form. She always did take after me, more than she should have. If I did die here, would she grow into her own person, or chase the shadow of someone who never came back. I wondered what lay on the other side, was there something more than the mundane life I’d grown to grieve.</p><p>Faux must have thought I was mad, always hesitating under doorways or gates. I’d done the same thing at the outer gate, the weight of doubts holding me back. As if stepping through would leave whatever certainty I had left behind.</p><p>It was peacefully quiet inside, the warmth a blessing from the bleak outdoors. The building felt a lot more inviting. The main door led us into a chamber with dark wood that lined the floors, soft handcrafted carpets and large cushioned settees. On the wall opposite me, a broad stone fireplace stood.  The hearth was wide, framed by carved stonework that rose upward in a towering chimney, vanishing somewhere into the heights of the ceiling. Bookshelves lined the walls, most lined with dust from decades of neglect. Large banners hung on the walls, depictions of the sun and twin moons were embroidered, not unlike the ones on Lord Astaron’s staff.</p><p>The room was empty save us, it seemed the other students still had duties or training to attend to. Faux plumped down into one of the seats near the fireplace, so I took one near him. He lit a match and got a fire going. We waited to warm up near the fire. I stared into the frantic flames, wondering if it was destiny or chance that had woven me onto this journey.</p><p>“Faux,” I started slowly, “Don’t tell anyone what happened to me either. Not a word.”</p><p>He gave me a puzzled look, but I leaned in before he could speak. “Some things aren’t meant to be spoken aloud. Not here, not anywhere. People think it’s unholy, sinful…” I let my words trail off, my chest tightening at the thought of what had happened. “Just promise me Faux, let it die in silence.”</p><p>He sat up straighter and promised. “You have my word.”</p><p>“So, how long do you think I’m stuck here for?” I asked Faux.</p><p>“Till Astaron trusts you to leave, I suppose.” He took a big gulp of water from a half empty glass on a nearby table. “What’s the hurry? Nothin’ out there for us. I came from Ashford myself. Up there, we’re nothin’ but rats roaming their cities to ‘em. They don’t want us there.”\t</p><p>“Don’t you all have families? People waiting for you? Lives to get back to?” I prodded.</p><p>“What d’you think happened to all these people?” Faux said, his voice grim. “They got nothin’ left, families butchered, enslaved, sold across the continent, never to see each other again. We came here with nothin’, but Astaron gave us something to climb up for. A purpose.”</p><p>He took a deep breath, his eyes were distant, “Some of us left things behind, things we can never go back to.”</p><p>“There’s nothin’ out there for us,” he repeated, more adamant this time. “Only we can carve out our own path.”</p><p>We sat in reticence for a while, him mulling over some darker thoughts in his mind, perhaps whatever he had <em>left</em> behind. </p><p>I picked a book from a nearby shelf and opened up to a random page. The writing was in a language I could not read. So I scrolled through the pages mindlessly, sparing a glance at the many diagrams and depictions of the anatomy of the brain. Without understanding the words, the diagrams were meaningless, so I closed the book and let the fire seep warmth back into my bones.</p><p>Eventually,  Faux leaned forward and rubbed his palms together. “Come on,” he muttered, standing with a stretch. “I’ll show you yer room. You’ll be bunkin’ with the others—don’t worry, they ain’t snore too loud.”</p><p>The bunk room, one of dozens, was dim and cramped. Light shone through from a small window, illuminating one half of the room. </p><p>“These two are empty—I think. Take whichever one ya want. And you get this closet for your things. Well, err, I don’t suppose you have any <em>things</em>.”</p><p> The other two beds were neatly made, blankets folded with care, tucked in properly at the edges. But the space around them was lived-in—boots left by the footboard, a half-unrolled satchel against the wall, and a couple of shirts draped carelessly over the back of a chair.</p><p>I took the bed in the far corner from the door, draped in darkness. Faux was right, I didn’t have any things, save for the clothes on my back. I made to hang the coat in one of the closets, before Faux stopped me. </p><p>“Don’t think this one fits ya, let me take this back. I’ll send someone to bring something more fittin’ to yer size,” so he took the coat back. He eyed me for a moment, as if getting the measurements for my clothes, then gestured towards the door. “You should eat. Others already had their share, but there’s still somethin’ left in the kitchens.”</p><p>Before I could say anything, he gave me a brief nod and stepped out, his footsteps thudding softly against the wooden floor as he disappeared down the hall. </p><p>The kitchen wasn’t far. A few embers still glowed in the hearth, and a plate of cold meat and bread sat under a linen cloth on the table. I ate quickly, the food plain but filling.</p><p>With Faux gone and nothing left to do in the evening, it seemed the perfect time to wander a little. The halls were dimly lit by hanging lanterns, their warm light flickering against the old stone. I passed by a study room lined with shelves,  papers, and stacks of tomes. A few desks sat beneath narrow windows, with pens still resting in place. All of it empty, save for a few servants working about.</p><p>Eventually, the stillness caught up with me. My body ached, not just from the pain and the cold, but from everything I’d been through. I returned to the dormitory and lay down on my new bed, its frame creaking lightly beneath me. The clean smell of the sheets, along with the quiet setting, made it easy to fall into a nap. </p><p>I don’t know how long I was out before I awoke to shouting. </p><p>“Oi! Get up! This ain’t a bloody resort for urchins!” Someone shouted at me.</p><p>My eyes fought to open. For a moment I wasn't sure where I was—the dark well, the shed, somewhere worse. My chest tightened before I recognized the wooden ceiling above me, the scratch of wool blankets against my skin. Real. This was real.</p><p>I didn’t recognize him at first. It was the fat kid I’d seen on my first day, Stubby, or whatever the others had called him. I belched from the smell, he reeked of sweat.  </p><p>“Did you hear me, how’d you get in here? You ain’t one of those strays they pick up from the mountain, are you?” he pulled a knife from his belt and started waving it around, as if it made him any more threatening.</p><p>I should have felt threatened. Instead I just stared at the blade, thinking how small it was. How insignificant. I'd survived worse than whatever this boy could do with his butter knife.</p><p>I rubbed my eyes open and stretched slowly, testing that my limbs still obeyed. There was another boy with him, the one who’d spoken out when Faux broke up the fight. </p><p>“Wait Tommy, I saw him with Faux earlier,” the other boy said, but Tommy, <em>Stubby</em>, was looking for a reason to swing. </p><p>Tommy’s knife wobbled in his chubby grip, more likely to slip and slice his own finger than anything else. “Don’t think I won’t use this!” he threatened, taking a step closer. The floor creaked beneath his weight.</p><p>“On who? Me or yourself?” I said. The words came out flatter than I meant. I was too tired for this. Too worn down to muster the energy for proper fear or anger.</p><p>The other boy, tall and lanky, snickered. He put a hand on Tommy’s shoulder. “Put it away mate. Faux wouldn’t bring in some rando without reason.”</p><p>Tommy huffed, still holding the knife out like it owed him something. </p><p>“Yea well, we’ll see about that. He looks a little too comfortable in that bed. And just sayin’, you’re sleeping awful close to my boots, stranger.”</p><p>I almost laughed. Almost. \"You worried I'll cuddle with them or something?\"</p><p>The lanky one chuckled. “Don’t mind Tommy here, he thinks every new face is either an assassin or here to steal his socks.” He stuck out a hand for me to shake, “Name’s Mirvel.”</p><p>“Rand’ar,” I shook it. His grip was warm, solid. Another small proof that I was here, present, alive.</p><p>Tommy finally sheathed his little knife, “What kinda wacko name is that,” he snorted. “Sounds like your momma sneezed when she came up with it.”</p><p>“They call you Stubby, so I wouldn’t be one to talk.”</p><p>Mirvel burst out laughing at that. Tommy stammered out, “It’s an endearing nickname, you just don’t get it.”</p><p>“Whatever you say.” I lay back down, pulling the blanket up. The simple act of lying in a real bed, in a room with other breathing people, felt like a mercy I didn't deserve. \"Now I'm going back to sleep.\"</p><p>We each settled into our beds, the room falling into a lull of shifting blankets and creaking frames. I kept my eyes open in the dark, watching the ceiling, making sure it stayed solid above me.</p><p>“We heard you were dead. Some rumour about a stray kid … frozen half dead at the bottom of a pit,” Mirvel said.</p><p>My throat tightened. \"People do love to talk.\"</p><p>They weren't far off. I had almost died. Just not the way they thought.</p><p>“They sure do. Truth is, there’s no one up here in the mountains except for us. So the older lads, they love spinning tales to keep us jumpy.”</p><p>“I’ve heard stories of cannibals in the Belt,” I said.</p><p>“Yea I’ve heard those too, but I ain’t seen it for myself. Although, that might just be because I’ve been snug in The Gauntlet all this while.” He shifted under his blanket. “Though they say part of training is they send you out into the mountains for a week. A group of four. No food, no fire. Just to see if you’ve got the grit for the cold.”</p><p>I stared up at the ceiling. “Sounds like a good way to fill those pit-rumours back up again.”</p><p>“Yeah.” His voice dropped quieter. “Still … better than rotting in here, right?”</p><p>I wasn't sure about that. But I didn't say so.</p><p>I could hear the wind howling despite the thick walls, rattling against the gables. I focused on Tommy's breathing, Mirvel's occasional shifts in his bed. The sounds were real. I was there with them, not falling through nothing.</p><p>“So . . . you’re not really a stray right?” he asked.</p><p>“Nah, I’m here to stay.” The words felt hollow, but maybe if I said them enough times, I'd believe them.</p><p>“Where’d you come from then, Veylands<strong>?</strong>” Mirvel asked.</p><p>I hesitated. The truth was a dangerous thing. It had already landed me imprisonment and torture for weeks. It was easier to go along with the question.</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Veylands.\"</p><p>“Which faction?” Tommy asked excitedly.</p><p>Shit. I didn't know enough to answer that. \"Small village. You wouldn't know it. \"</p><p>\"Try me. My cousin worked the river trade routes, been all over.\"</p><p>My mind raced. I knew nothing about Veylands geography, their cities, or their rivers. One wrong detail and I'd be caught.</p><p>\"Look,\" I said, keeping my voice low. \"I'd rather not talk about home. Lost people there. That's why I'm here.\"</p><p>Mirvel's expression softened slightly. Tommy grunted but didn't push.</p><p>It wasn't the truth. But it was a lie that might hold. At least for now.</p><p>Soon they both fell asleep, and I could hear Tommy’s incessant snoring. I lay there listening to it, grateful for the noise. For the first time in weeks, I wasn't alone. I was with my people, even if I felt like a stranger among them. Even if part of me was still falling through that dark place, wondering if I'd ever truly climbed out.</p><p>But I was here. In this bed. In this room. And tomorrow I'd wake up and prove it again.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The weeks that followed were a blur of duties, studies, and training. A vast change from the posh, pompous life and culture I came from. Also a vast change from the blood and grime of the box. Cleaning duties were no longer the concern of some slave or servant, they were my own burden. The incompetence I had feigned with Doctor Oroya no longer worked with Orem. He gave me three days of leniency—three days to find my footing, before I would be subject to the same standards as the rest of the Kethalan recruits. </p><p>Three days later, it seemed the broom did not want to work with me. And Orem had a special way of making sure I knew it. With me, he’d inspect every corner and examine every shelf. He even made me run my fingers on the ground and show them to him for inspection. If there was any dust, it was ten minutes outside without a coat. He said it built character, the only thing it built was frostbite. </p><p>Mirvel and Tommy told me to watch out for Orem, not to get on his bad side. They told me how they’d heard stories from the older men, about an old recruit who was tired of the punishing demands and picked a fight with Orem. By the time Orem was done, the boy could barely stand, beaten and bloodied well. That was hardly the end of his struggles. They threw him out into the cold for the night, and come morning, they found him frozen stiff, trousers halfway down as if he’d collapsed mid-piss. After hearing that, I learned quickly not to test my luck like I’d done with Astaron.</p><p>If the duties didn’t wear me down, the studies certainly tried. Lessons were either held inside a cramped room that smelled fairly of ink and books or outside in the courtyard for demonstrations. Orem or one of the other instructors would drone on about history, tactics and the Sagaryn subjugation, although there wasn’t much recorded history past <em>The Mass Withdrawal</em>. History that was common knowledge where I had come from. </p><p>They made us memorize and interpret maps, learn code signals, and study tactics. Although I noticed the maps they gave us never marked exactly where we were, it was clear they didn’t trust us—or me. Instead we studied the geography of everywhere else, as if the wider world mattered more than the ground beneath us.</p><p>We learned of two sovereign realms South of us. There was The Veylan Lands, a fertile realm known for its river valleys and many trade routes. It was also the bigger of the two. The second was The Droskar Territories, a fractured realm marked by its many fortress cities, always bleeding with constant skirmishes. On the surface, the two kingdoms were locked in rivalry, their rulers eager to claim the barren stretch of wilderness we occupied. Not because they valued the land, but because to them a kingdom was only as mighty as the borders it swallowed.</p><p>But beneath it all, both Veylan and Droskar patricians hung from the strings above. Their crowns were bought and painted by their true masters. Their wars, their rivalries, their hunger for conquest—it was all theater, staged, to hide the true ruling power. All while the peasants suffered the same, their false freedom an unholy lie, sinful to question, and painful to hold true. They believe that this was what freedom looked like, riddled with wars and the blood of their children. But those were the questions for lords and kings. For me, freedom meant something far simpler: surviving another day of drills under Orem’s gaze.</p><p>It seemed Mirvel was right, Orem loved singling out Tommy. Nothing Tommy could do was right in Orem’s piercing eyes, whether it was fumbling the answer to a question about battle formations, or even holding a map the “wrong” way during lessons. And it seemed that Orem had found a second target to scrutinize—me. And it only further pissed him off that Tommy and I were always together, every mistake by one of us was amplified by the other’s presence. </p><p>While the studying was a strain on my mind, and a pain to endure, the training was where I shined. For as long as I can remember, the blade and I moved together. There were countless nights where my father and I trained in the courtyard in the moonlight. He said the absence of light helped focus the rest of my senses, so I could hear and feel the opponent's blade without seeing it. My footing would be uneasy on the grass, and that’s where Father cornered me most, and these sessions often ended with a bruise or a cut. </p><p>Sometimes my mother would watch us from under the pink tree on the far end of the courtyard. The moonlight spilled through the branches, shining down on her hazel hair. She never spoke, never interfered, even though she wanted to tell my father to go easy on me. There was something calming about her gaze, like she was rooting for me to push through, her presence tethered me to the moment. On nights where Father’s blade left a cut, on my arm or a bruise in my ribs, I’d glance her way. She’d offer a faint smile—soft and reassuring—that was enough to steady me. And after we’d finish the training, I would jump in her open and waiting arms. </p><p>I was never bitter towards Father for his harsh lessons; I understood even then that his blade was meant to carve me into something stronger. When my parents passed and my aunt and uncle took me in, they hired a swordmaster named Esteban. But I suppose his mastery was untrue, since I would overwhelm him more often than not. </p><p>In time I stopped attending his lessons altogether, it wasn’t just his lack of skill, but nothing could replace the dark nights of training with my father. Esteban’s teachings lacked weight, and his strikes lacked purpose. So I took to training my younger sister, Minarra, instead. Passing on what Father taught me. With her, the courtyard felt alive again, and Daryen and the others would come to watch. For a time, it almost felt as those nights under the pink tree had returned. But that was another life, lost to me, and the weight of it faded as Hurbasa’s voice snapped me back to the present.</p><p>“Rand’ar. Stop!” he barked.</p><p>I froze, chest heaving, the wooden blade still raised in my hands. Across from me, Dan, my sparring partner, was sprawled on the floor, his hands raised in fear. His wooden sword had rolled a few feet away, useless to him now.</p><p>“Damn it, boy,” Hurbasa strode forward, and snatched the practice sword from my grip with his right hand. “This isn’t a street brawl. When your opponent yields, <em>you stop.</em>”</p><p>I stood there in shame, my mind had wandered to the past, the old memories had consumed me, and Dan had gotten hurt because of it. I offered him my hand to get him up, but he swatted it away and muttered something about me being an “enraged monkey.” I deserved it, but I wanted to spit something back anyway. But the glares from the others circling the training floor stopped me. I flicked my eyes toward Mirvel, who just shook his head in disappointment. </p><p>“Since you want to play dirty,” Hurbasa growled, his voice carried across the room. He raised his hand and pointed toward the ring, “you’ll face Kalandyr next.”</p><p>Murmurs went around the room—low and uncomfortable. I heard Tommy’s sharp intake of breath from behind me, saw Mirvel’s eyes go wide for a moment before his face went blank. Around the room, recruits shifted, some leaning forward with the anticipation of watching a beating, others suddenly finding the floor very interesting.</p><p>Then he stepped forward into the ring. </p><p>The same boy who'd dismantled Tommy on my first day, the one who’d moved with precision and speed. Kalandyr walked toward the ring like he'd done this a hundred times before, no swagger, no visible emotion. Just the quiet certainty of someone who knew exactly what was about to happen and found it routine. He had an air of bored confidence. </p><p>My body still ached from the weeks before. I was tired. My muscles were heavy with the particular exhaustion that came after a fight fueled by anger rather than strategy.</p><p>Hurbasa had called him specifically. Not just some recruit. He had said, ‘<em>Since you want to play dirty.’ </em>I’d clearly revealed too much, that I’d been trained, and now he was testing me with his best student.</p><p>Or maybe just to punish me for it, it wouldn’t be out of character with the miserable people here. </p><p>Someone muttered, “He only calls up Kal when he wants to make a point.” That didn’t ease my thoughts.</p><p>Kalandyr stepped into the ring without ceremony, picked up a practice sword, didn’t even test its weight and stood there with a dull expression. Simply waiting for it to be over. He didn’t even look at me directly. His eyes were dark and unreadable</p><p>“Well?” Hurbasa’s voice cut through my hesitation. \"Get in the ring.” He threw the wooden sword at my feet.</p><p>I stepped forward. Around us, the recruits had gone quiet, watching. I wasn’t sure what they were looking for. A duel, or a beating. </p><p>I picked up the practice sword, it felt heavier than before, laden with my doubts.</p><p>Kalandyr hadn’t spoken, he hadn’t even moved. He simply … waited. Patient in a predatory way Dan’s wild senseless swinging could never be.</p><p>My father always told me, <em>never fight angry, and never fight tired</em>. I wondered how often he abided by those rules in his quest for rebellion. </p><p>I was about to break both.</p><p>Hurbasa’s hand dropped, “Begin.”</p><p>Before Hurbasa’s hand had even dropped to his side, Kalandyr was already moving. </p><p>He moved fast.</p><p>Kalandyr came at me with a high swing aimed for my chest. The muscle memory overrode my exhaustion as my sword arm came up to deflect the attack. The deflection was clean, textbook even. Too clean. I'd just shown more than I'd meant to. The wood cracked against wood and made a sound that left the other recruits flinching. </p><p> The impact singed down my arms and left me wincing, my ribs still healing.</p><p>Then he was gone, already back at the other side of the ring. His face betrayed no emotion but he was surprised. He hadn’t expected me to deflect his attack, he was used to practicing against much slower opponents. </p><p>Kalandyr paused. Not long—barely a breath—but enough that I knew he’d noticed. His stance shifted. Whatever calm assessment he had planned was over.</p><p>My heart hammered against my chest. The crowd's murmurs had died completely.</p><p>We circled around the floor, each wary of the other’s skill. My bare feet gripped the mat tightly, sweat poured down my forehead. One of us had to strike again. </p><p>I had to regain control, make him think the first block was luck, reflex, anything but a trained response. I could’ve ended it there, taken the next hit and went down. But I'd seen the faces watching when I'd deflected Kalandyr's opening strike—Tommy's surprise, Mirvel's sudden attention, even the older recruits were leaning forward. If I folded now, what would I tell them, it was blind luck? That I was weak?</p><p>And Astaron. He'd kept me alive because he expected something from me, even if I didn't know what. Showing nothing but incompetence wouldn't keep me useful—it would make me disposable. </p><p>I needed the middle ground. Competent enough to be taken seriously, but not skilled enough to draw too much attention. But not so polished that Hurbasa or the others started wondering exactly who had trained the refugee boy. Only Astaron needed to see who I was. I was Haestus’ son.</p><p>Fine. I’d give them a fight, just not the one Father would have expected.</p><p>I focused on his stance, it was relaxed, his sword arm out to his side, his other arm behind his back, as if inviting me to come attack. </p><p>I knew it was bait. I took it anyway.</p><p>Three strikes, fast and hard, I aimed to break his guard and go in for a tap. I put my full weight behind each one—like Tommy might’ve—aiming to break that infuriating calm.</p><p><em>Crack. Crack. Crack.</em></p><p>The screeching sound of wood against wood rang hard in my ears as he parried each of my attacks effortlessly, barely shifting his feet. But his eyes had changed, he wasn’t buying it.</p><p>“Interesting.” he said, voice flat. Then he moved.</p><p>His counterattack came immediately. It was a technique I’d recognized instantly. Father had drilled it into me a thousand times. It was too easy.</p><p>His blade feinted left, I took the lure, overcommitting to the strike like someone who’d seen the obvious play and panicked. </p><p>Then the sweep came low, as I’d expected. A quick swipe at my legs. I threw myself backward—not a clean dodge, but a stumbling half-fall that looked like desperation. I landed on my heels and nearly went down for real.</p><p>His wooden sword rose for the finishing strike, aimed at my exposed torso while I was off-balance and vulnerable.</p><p>But my sword arm was ready. As his strike pierced toward me, barely, just barely did I deflect it. The angle was wrong, not the way I’d practiced, so it really was a clumsy parry. </p><p>The hit pushed me back and one knee hit the mat. The exhaustion was catching up fast. Weeks in the box had left me weakened. </p><p>I pushed myself up, breathing hard, making it look like that exchange had cost me everything. But I'd defended all three strikes. Desperately, but I'd defended them.</p><p>Kalandyr stood opposite me, his sword lowered. “You read that before I moved.” He said.</p><p>The room had gone quiet.</p><p>“No, I didn’t. Just got lucky I suppose” I said.</p><p>“You did. You were off-balance, yet you blocked my every move. Your sword arm was always in position. That’s not luck.”</p><p>I tried to keep my breathing ragged, to seem more tired than I am. I got down on one knee to catch my breath. “I’ve seen that combination before. Back home, soldiers training outside in the yards. I used to watch them sometimes when I was young.”</p><p>“And you simply … remembered? Years later, in the midst of a duel?”</p><p>He stepped closer, close enough I could see the thoughts forming behind his eyes. I got back up before he reached. </p><p>“Useful memory you’ve got, but that’s just not true.” </p><p>I said nothing. </p><p>“Who trained you?”</p><p>Before I could even answer, Hurbasa’s voice whipped through the hall. “I didn’t call you up here to have a chat. Kalandyr, get back in line. Rand’ar, go join the others.”</p><p>Kalandyr’s question hung in the air between us. He held my gaze for a moment longer, one last scrutinizing look as if that would help him decipher the truth.</p><p>I pushed through to the back of the group, legs shaking. My ribs ached where they still hadn't fully healed. Around the ring, the other recruits were already turning back to their own sparring, the brief entertainment over.</p><p>Hurbasa’s eyes followed me to the edge of the room. \"You'll do,\" he said, flat and dismissive. Not praise. Just acknowledgement that I wasn't completely useless.</p><p>I grabbed a rag from a bench and wiped the sweat off my face. A thought struck me then, unwelcome and cold. During all those weeks in the box, that woman had never asked about the North's defenses, never pressed for names of contacts or co-conspirators. Every question had been the same: who sent you, how did you find us. As if she'd already known the answer. As if she'd been asking the wrong questions on purpose.</p><p>But why would she already know? And if she knew, what had she been looking for instead?</p><p>I pushed the doubts away. It did not matter, I was surviving, barely scraping by, I had to focus on just making it through.</p><p>Across the room, Kalandyr had already picked up his wooden sword and was getting ready for another fight. Poor fool, whoever fought him. </p><p>Tommy appeared at my side, handed me a water skin. \"Thought he was gonna kill you for a second there cuz.\"</p><p>“Yeah,” I said, gulping down the water. I had forgotten how thirsty a fight can get. “Me too.”</p><p>Mirvel leaned against the wall nearby. \"You held your own though. More than most do against Kal.\"</p><p>“Hmm.” I said. I had held my own, but that hadn’t meant I’d won, and we all knew it. I couldn’t risk a fight like that again, I’d already revealed too much. I was sure someone would come asking questions. Maybe Kalandyr, maybe someone else, but when those questions would come, I’d be ready.<br /></p>"

The terrible hot breath in my face, “You owe us, we all saw what you can—”</p><p>“What the hell are you all talking about?” I managed to get out.</p><p>“The Trial, obviously,” someone spoke up from behind me.</p><p>“Bullshit, he doesn’t owe anyone—” Mirvel snapped.</p><p>“Stay out of this, no one asked you to play white knight. I’m talking to—”</p><p>The voices blurred together. No, I could hear them all distinctively, at the same time, yet I could not focus on any of them. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t focus on anything but the noise. The food on my plate was still warm, but I didn’t feel like eating, not with the overwhelming shouting all around me. </p><p>The smell of sweat and body odour was overwhelming. At any point I thought I might puke, I had to get out of the crowd. But there were people packed all around me. They were all huddling together, hollering at each other, squawking in my ears. If anything, I knew I didn’t want to join them.</p><p>\"—just one spot in my group, that's all I'm—\"</p><p>\"He's not picking you, are you stupid—\"</p><p>\"I can get us through the lower pass if—\"</p><p>Another hand, this one gripping my forearm. \"Listen to me, just listen—\"</p><p>I shoved his grip away, but another person grabbed my shoulder. “Three days, that’s all we have before—”</p><p>\"—heard people die out there every year—\"</p><p>“Shut up, you’re just trying to scare—”</p><p>“Maybe <em>you’re</em> scared—”</p><p>The voices were too much, they each climbed up over each other, reaching the ceiling far above me, only to fall down right into my ears. There were three, maybe four people pressed up against me, and I could hear their heartbeats thumping loudly in their chests. I could feel their anxious anticipation—who would I choose?</p><p>I didn’t want any of them.</p><p>I clenched my hands under the table. I had survived the storm with no equipment. I had endured that woman’s punishment. I had survived, and I would continue doing so. I didn’t need their help. What had these people done except beg? </p><p>\"—you have to understand, without someone who can—\"</p><p>\"Get off me,\" I yelled. It was too quiet, no one had heard me except Tommy, who gave me a queasy look.</p><p>\"—my brother died in the trial last year, I can't—\"</p><p>A hand grabbed my bad shoulder, the one still healing from the fight. Pain flared down my arm.</p><p>“I said—” I shoved the hand away, pushing it into someone else's face, “get OFF!”</p><p>Everyone went quiet for a moment, all the pointless bickering and screaming, it all died down. Oh, how peaceful that moment felt after the senseless yapping in my ears. I noticed Kalandyr in the far end of the dining hall, munching on his food quietly. He sat alone, and didn't look like he could care about the trial. Why didn’t they bother him instead?</p><p>My respite lasted mere moments, ever fleeting, before the quarreling started up again. </p><p>“Real nice,” someone muttered. “We just want to—”</p><p>“I’m just saying, one fight against Kal, thinks he’s—”</p><p>“Didn’t even win that fight—” another voice cut in, sharper.</p><p>\"Lay off him,\" Tommy said, stepping closer. \"He doesn't owe you anything.\"</p><p>\"Oh, so you've already got your little group sorted then? That it?\"</p><p>“We’re just asking—”</p><p>“You’re not asking, you’re demanding.” Mirvel shot back.</p><p>“And what, you two get first pick because you sleep in the same room.”</p><p>“What else is going on in that room?” Someone shouted, snickering.</p><p>“Oh, piss off.” Tommy said, shoving the boy.</p><p>That started a fight. Mirvel rushed to try to calm the other kid down, but it was too late. The shouting exploded, everyone rushed around them to pick a side, the bodies scuffling everywhere.</p><p>I couldn’t hear anything except the buzz of shouting. My head was pounding behind my eyes, threatening to pierce my skull. I used the chaos to slip away. My vision swam as I pushed past the edge of the crowd. Had to put a hand on the wall to steady myself. The voices were already quieter here, just a few steps away, but my head still throbbed with each heartbeat.</p><p>No one had noticed I’d left, they were too focused on Tommy swinging at some kid twice his height. No one except Kalandyr, his eyes were on me the whole time. </p><p>I stumbled through the winding hallways back to the dorm room, the headache immediately getting better without the inordinate racket in the dining hall. Tommy shouldn’t have fought for me, I had never asked for it. I didn’t want the attention it would bring, but part of me was grateful that he did. But this had complicated things.</p><p>I didn’t want friends, didn’t need them. Had always coasted through on my own. I wasn’t allowed to make friends in the North, and I’m glad for it, it always ends in disappointment or betrayal. </p><p>I’d just burned my only chance to find capable teammates. Now I was stuck with Tommy, who picked fights he couldn't win, and Mirvel. Now we were a team by default—not because I'd chosen them, but because I'd run from choosing anyone else. They defended me, and I’d wondered if I could have found someone more competent for the trial instead. The guilt sat heavy in my heart, but not heavy enough to erase the doubt. I had to survive the trial, gain Astaron’s trust and learn about who Father really was.</p><p>I collapsed into the bed, desperate to squeeze out the pain in my skull. I pressed my palms against my eyes until the throbbing eased. There were footsteps in the hallway. The door swung open.</p><p>\"Thought you might be here,\" he said, shutting it behind him. He didn't ask if I was okay, just pulled up a chair and sat. </p><p>We waited in silence until Tommy arrived, knuckles bloody, grinning despite the split lip. </p><p>“Got him good.” He said, wiping the blood off his lip. I was surprised, I expected him to get his arse handed to him.</p><p>“Was it worth it?” Mirvel sighed. </p><p>“Aye, it was. That trick you showed me yesterday was real proper, cuz.”</p><p>“Hmm, which one?” I asked.</p><p>“Stepped into his reach when he swung, just like you told me.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that make you easier to hit?” Mirvel asked.</p><p>“They expect you to back up, ruins their momentum when you don't.” I said, still rubbing my temple. “Why’d you jump in, Tommy?”</p><p>“Don’t mention it.” He grinned.</p><p>“No, you shouldn’t have done that. I could’ve handled it myself.”</p><p>“Sure, you looked real calm.” Tommy’s grin faded, “Like you were two seconds from breaking that guy's arm.\"</p><p>\"I had it under control.\"</p><p>\"You didn't,\" Mirvel said quietly. \"You were shaking.\"</p><p>I opened my mouth to argue, then stopped. They were right. I hadn’t had it under control.</p><p>\"Look,\" Tommy said, flexing his bruised knuckles, \"you don't get to tell me when to fight. That's my call, not yours.\"</p><p>\"And when they come after you for it? When Orem finds out and you're scrubbing floors for a week? Or worse, out in the storm for a night?\"</p><p>“Then I better get scrubbing, and better learn how to make a fire.” He shrugged. “Worth it.”</p><p>\"We're not gonna stand there and watch people talk to you like shit,\" Mirvel cut in. \"You can handle yourself, fine. But that doesn't mean you have to.\"</p><p>“I don’t need—”</p><p>“Yea you do.” Tommy sat leaning against the wall. “Maybe not need, but … we’re in this together now, right cuz? The trial, all of it. That means we’ve got your back, and you better got ours.”</p><p>I much preferred to do things on my own, then everything is in my own hands, the successes and the failures. Other people are a complication, unpredictable, and never as structured. But I needed the allies … and the friends. They’d proven their loyalty, it was time for me to prove mine. </p><p>“So, guess we’re a team then, for The Trial I mean. I don’t get it though, why did everyone care to team with me so much? Just because I held my own against Kalandyr? Isn’t the trial about surviving?” I asked.</p><p>Mirvel and Tommy exchanged a glance.</p><p>“It is about surviving,” Mirvel said carefully. “But not just the cold and the mountain. There are … other groups out there.”</p><p>\"What do you mean, other groups?\"</p><p>“Trial ain’t just our year,” Tommy said. \"It's anyone who hasn't completed it yet. Could be fifty, sixty people scattered across the mountains. Maybe more.\"</p><p>“And they’re all competing for the same resources. Food, shelter, and any other equipment they scatter out before the trial. Sometimes groups run into each other.\"</p><p>“And when they do?” I asked.</p><p>Tommy's grin was humorless. \"Depends on the group. Some trade. Some avoid each other. Some...\" He shrugged. \"Fight for what the other has.\"</p><p>“People die out there, every year.” Mirvel said. “It’s a culling farm, keep the best and let go of the rest. Sometimes it’s the cold, or the wolves, but mostly, it’s just the other recruits.”</p><p>I stared at them. \"So everyone wanted me because—\"</p><p>“Because you can fight,” Tommy finished. \"And out there, that matters more than knowing which berries are safe to eat.\"</p><p>“So why don’t they ask Kalandyr? He’s a better fighter than I am.”</p><p>“He’s been here for a few years, did the trial a while—” Mirvel said.</p><p>“Apparently, he did it by himself.” Tommy butted in. Of course he did the trial himself.</p><p>“Shut up, someone definitely made that up. No one’s doing the trial alone, only a fool would.” Mirvel said.</p><p>So what, that leaves me as the next best choice? At least I wouldn’t need to fight Kalandyr. But we still needed to survive out there, and I wouldn’t consider stumbling through the storm good experience. We’d need to hunt, stay warm, and keep safe from the others. And most importantly, we needed to stand out.</p><p>Astaron held the answers I'd come here for—who my father really was, why he'd left, what he'd done before abandoning it all. <em>Prove yourself</em>, he’d said. The old man wouldn't share the tales of Haestus with some mediocre recruit who barely scraped through training. He'd share it with someone who'd earned his attention.</p><p>“You're just jealous no one’s making up stories about you like that.” Tommy cooed back.</p><p>\"When I survive the trial, they'll have plenty to say,\" Mirvel said proudly.</p><p>Tommy and Mirvel weren't the teammates I would've chosen if I'd had time to think, to plan, to assess who could help me succeed. But they'd stood up for me when no one else had. They'd chosen me before I'd chosen them.</p><p>That had to count for something.</p><p>\"So we're agreed then,\" I said. \"The three of us.\"</p><p>\"The three of us,\" Mirvel confirmed.</p><p>Tommy cracked his knuckles and grinned. \"Just try to keep up.\"</p><p>Outside, the wind howled against the wooden walls, a stark reminder of where we’d be spending our nights in just a few days. A week in the cold, outside, with the wolves, other recruits, and whatever else the Belt could throw at us.</p><p>We just had three days to prepare.</p><p>I could only pray that’d be enough.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The morning of the trial came faster than I’d wanted. We hadn’t had enough time to prepare, despite the full days of training, making fires, and hunting. The sky was a bland grey, and the wind had slowed to a still, the weather inviting us to the outdoors, only to trap us later.</p><p>The groups had been a mix of choice and assignment. Besides me, Mirvel and Tommy, we had a fourth. A scrawny boy named Jorik who looked like he’d been starved all his life—all sharp angles and hollowed cheeks. His hands were stained dark around the fingernails, and when he caught me looking, he tucked them into his sleeves.</p><p> I suspected he’d be the first to go, fading into the cold dark before we’d even made it three days in. </p><p>“I can work a snare,” he’d said quietly, after first being assigned to our group, and as we discussed in our dorm. “And gut whatever gets caught in it. Won't waste any of the meat.\"</p><p>“Great,” Tommy said, “So you can hunt.”</p><p>“Well, err, no. Not hunt. I mean—I set traps. Snares. For small game, rabbits mostly. And I can clean them proper. Use everything. The meat, the pelt, the sinew. Nothing wasted. I can—I mean, I know how to do it right. Won't waste nothing.\"</p><p>Tommy raised an eyebrow, “So you <em>can’t </em>hunt.”</p><p>“I set snares. Snares.” Jorik repeated. “It’s not the same as hunting, but it works. Keeps you fed. I can do it. I know how.”</p><p>“We heard you the first time.” Mirvel said unkindly.</p><p>Jorik’s hands twisted in his sleeves.“Right, sorry. Just … making sure you heard me.”</p><p>Today he shifted uncomfortably beside me. Out in the grand courtyard where all of us recruits stood. </p><p>As we stood there in the open, I noticed Kalandyr among the older Kethalan standing near the walls. What were they doing out here? They’d already completed the trial. Kalandyr’s violet eyes found mine for a brief moment before I looked away.</p><p>\"What are the older ones doing?\" I asked Mirvel.</p><p>He shrugged. \"No idea. Probably just seeing us off.\"</p><p>Hurbasa was laying out the rules and explaining the trial. Astaron stood next to him, his face shadowed by that iron hat.</p><p>“You’ve all each been given a pack with a flask, compass, firestarter, a bedroll and a day's worth of rations.” His voice boomed through the courtyard. All around us, the towering mountains looked down at us, daring us to leave the safety of The Gauntlet, to enter their domain. “Beside that, each of your groups has been supplied with a rope, a map and some basic medical supplies. Lose any of these, and your journey may end with no return.”</p><p>“Your objective: reach the summit of Kael's Peak.\" He gestured toward the mountains behind him, somewhere in that vast white expanse. \"It's marked on your maps. Three days to reach the base if you take the direct route, longer if you don't. Then the climb itself—another two days, depending on your path and your pace.\"</p><p>He paused, letting it sink in. Two weeks. Maybe more. I shivered at the thought, two weeks in the blinding cold. I looked around at our little motley crew. Tommy cracked his knuckles, Mirvel looked bored, Jorik shivered beside me. We’d need other allies.</p><p>\"There are multiple routes up the mountain. Some are faster but more exposed. Others take longer but offer shelter and game. Choose wisely—your route will determine more than just how quickly you finish.\" His eyes swept across the assembled groups. \"It will determine if you finish at all.\"</p><p>Murmurs spread throughout the crowd. Someone whispered something about other groups, and fighting for the best paths.</p><p>\"You will encounter other groups,\" Hurbasa continued, as if he'd heard. \"How you handle such encounters is your decision. You’ve each been armed with a sword and a beetle bow—although I’d recommend, keep the bow for hunting. But remember, reaching the summit and returning proves that you are worthy for the next phase of your training. Dead men don’t complete trials, so choose carefully.”</p><p>I glanced at the beetle bow strapped to my belt. Small enough to fit in one hand, with a spring-loaded lever built into the grip. Squeeze to compress the spring and draw the string, release the trigger with your thumb to fire. Quick at close range, accurate enough for hunting at distance. I'd seen a few of the older recruits training with them—compact, light, easier to learn than a longbow. The name came from how it looked when squeezed: the curved arms contracting like a beetle folding its antennae.</p><p>Astaron finally stepped forward, striking his long staff against the pale stone.</p><p>“Some of you will not return—<em>unworthy</em>,” he said, his voice not as loud as Hurbasa’s, but every recruit inched forward to hear it. “Some of you will fail—<em>unworthy</em>. Some of you will return emptyhanded—<em>unworthy</em>. And some will die. They will be the most <em>unworthy</em> of all.”</p><p>Someone from the back of the crowd shot out, “And what happens if we’re unworthy?”</p><p>“The Gauntlet doesn't keep dead weight. You'll be removed—contracts transferred to whoever will take you. I have no use for failures.\" Astaron’s response was cold, as if this was just the way of things.</p><p>“You came here as nothing. If you can’t prove yourselves otherwise, you’ll go back as nothing. Simple as that.” Hurbasa added.</p><p>The courtyard was silent, save Jorik’s shivering.</p><p>“But those of you who complete the trial, those of you who push through the cold, fear, hunger and stand atop that peak, those of you will be <em>worthy</em>. You will have proven you are more than recruits. You will have become Kethalan Bellators.\"</p><p>His eyes found mine, for just a moment, and I knew he was telling me to show him why I was<em> worthy</em>.</p><p>“The trial begins now. Stay firm, stay faithful.”</p><p>The courtyard erupted into motion. The groups scattered toward the opulent gates, some rushing, others trudging along. I saw Tommy and Mirvel already sprinting toward the village past the inner gate. I took one last look at the compound around me, at the towering walls, training halls, at the grandeur of it all, and the safety we were leaving behind.</p><p>Jorik stood frozen beside me, so I nudged him forward and we started sprinting too. I was a good runner, but Jorik was even faster than I was. He may have looked feeble, but he had a fire within him.</p><p>All of the recruits did, they all had a grim determination about them. Slaves given freedom, they knew this was their chance to prove themselves worthy and get back at their former masters and free their people.</p><p>But unlike them, I didn’t have that fire within me. I was in this cause purely for my own selfish reasons. Yet it mattered to me more than anything else.</p><p>The first few hours passed in a blur of movement. We'd headed in the general direction of the peak—south and east, following the sparse treeline until the compound disappeared behind us, marking our trail along the map as we went. Gradually, as the terrain forced decisions, many of the groups diverged, each taking their own path forward. Some climbed higher into the ridges. Others descended into the valleys.</p><p>By the time the sun reached its peak, most had scattered, there was still the odd group visible in the distance. Dark shapes draping across the white snow, barely visible.</p><p>We stopped at the edge of a group of trees that offered some shelter from the wind. Tommy dropped his pack with a grunt, Jorik collapsed against a boulder, and Mirvel pulled out the map.</p><p>“We need to decide,” Mirvel started. “Before we go any deeper, what’s our plan forward?”</p><p>We all looked at him blankly, how could we choose the path? Make the wrong decision and it’d be the end for us. We had to choose the path that had access to hunt, shelter in case of a storm, and the least resistance. </p><p>“Look, I’ve been studying the maps of The Belt from the library, and there are three main approaches toward Kael’s peak. Northern route follows the ridgeline, southern cuts through the valley, western route moves through the forest before climbing up.”</p><p>He traced the three paths with his gloved fingers.</p><p>“Northern looks the fastest, I’d say two days to the base, maybe less. But it’s exposed, no shelter, no cover from the wind or a storm. Any group that values speed will take it.”</p><p>“Western?” I asked.</p><p>“Longer, three days, maybe four if we’re slow. The forest has game and shelter. But it funnels everyone through one path once the trees finish. Choke points. If groups want to ambush or control resources, that's where they'll wait.\" He tapped his finger on where the forest finished and the climb started. </p><p>Tommy leaned over the map, “Southern one?” </p><p>“Four or five days, but we avoid most of the groups since they’ll want to take the shorter paths. We’d have to traverse around the entire base before starting our climb.” He made a tracing motion from the compound in the north to the southern base of Kael. </p><p>“It has more shelter from the elements, better hunting with cover for Jorik's snares. The climb from the base is gradual, making it easier before the final push. It’s not the fastest, but it’s the safest from both the elements and the other groups.”</p><p>“So we’d be avoiding the crowds.” I asked. That’s what worried me most. People would jump to quick violence out in the wild with no consequences. </p><p>“Mostly. There’ll still be some groups, but not the desperate ones looking for easy targets or the fastest routes.”</p><p>He continued, “I don’t want to make the final decision, you guys should decide.”</p><p>“Southern route,” I said immediately. “We avoid the crowd and we gather food before the final climb. Anyone taking the northern route is underestimating how long it’ll take to get up and will probably starve before making it halfway up.”</p><p>Jorik looked relieved and Tommy nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Southern it is,” Mirvel folded the map away, careful to not let the snow dampen the paper.</p><p>“Let’s move now, cover as much ground as we can today and put some distance between us and the other groups. If a scuffle breaks out in one of the other routes, more groups might filter towards the southern one, so let’s get ahead,” I said.</p><p>“Agreed,” Mirvel said.</p><p>We shouldered our packs and headed towards whatever awaited south.</p><p>I was keeping watch, stuck beyond the safety of the rock outcropping we had set up under for the night. A crude shelter made of sticks and firs, and the thin bedroll was all that protected us from the elements.  We had a fire going earlier but the blazing winds had snuffed out the embers. </p><p>I sat in the branches of a nearby tree and felt the soft snow falling on my cheeks. It was the second night since we’d left the compound, we were halfway to the southern base, careful to avoid the obvious trails down south. </p><p>I considered getting up to check Jorik’s snares, they were our primary source of food, but alas, it was too cold, and I didn’t want to go far from the group. They all slept so peacefully, like this was all normal—just another day. </p><p>My sleep had been restless, I was jolted awake by the lightest crunches, the shuffling of blankets, and the shrieking of gusts. </p><p>As the wind slowed down, I jumped down to get the fire going again. The embers from the previous had long since died, leaving only soot and ash. </p><p>I pulled the firestarter from my pack, along with a small pouch of dry tinder we'd collected yesterday. My fingers were stiff from the cold, clumsy as I arranged the tinder in a small pile. </p><p>I struck the steel against the flint. Once. Twice. A spark landed, and I leaned in close, cupping my hands around it. The wind came to a still, the cold was a lot easier to bear suddenly, and the sounds of nature all came out. </p><p>Suddenly, I heard the distant sound of something crunching in the snow. Footsteps—no two sets, coming from opposite directions. One was far off, staying far beyond the perimeter of our camp, almost out of range.</p><p>I strained to track both, but the closer, heavier set demanded my attention. The sound was getting closer, it was coming from beyond the rock outcrop, I heard the dull voices of whispers, but I couldn’t be sure. Multiple voices. A group.</p><p>The distant footsteps faded away into the background, either moving away or overclouded by the closer set. We were being flanked, perhaps two groups that had allied. I wasn’t sure what to do, wake the others? Kill the fire? They had no doubt seen the smoke by now. I quickly nudged Jorik awake, the lightest of the sleepers. </p><p>“Footsteps, two groups, get your weapons ready, and wake the others.” I motioned him to stay quiet as I peeked over the boulders, it was too dark to see clearly but there must’ve been four figures, one of them carrying a lone torch. Definitely a group.</p><p>I heard their groaning as Jorik woke the others.</p><p>“Quiet,” I hissed.</p><p>“How the hell’d they find us?” Tommy whispered.</p><p>“Shut up, probably our footprints,” Mirvel answered. “What do they want though?” </p><p>“Get your weapons ready, and watch our flank, there might be someone going around.” I pointed at the trees behind us without turning back, my eyes still focused on the group ahead. They were running toward us, their footfalls making deep crunches in the snow. </p><p>My mind raced. Could I circle around fast enough? Come at them while they were focused on the others? No, that’d leave them exposed, and too risky to get lost in the dark. If they saw me, I’d be isolated, easy pickings. Besides, there’s the person watching from behind us, we had to be prepared for two groups. </p><p>Better we faced them together. Let them make the first move. </p><p>“Tommy, Jorik, get your bows ready and stand behind us, one of you keep an eye on the treeline, there might be another group.”</p><p>“You sure? I don’t hear anything behind us,” Mirvel piped up.</p><p>“Just trust me,” I didn’t have time to explain.</p><p>The footsteps stopped just beyond the firelight. Four shapes, barely visible in the darkness, the torch casting long shadows behind them.</p><p>“Oi, we know you’re awake.” A voice called out. Male, a deep voice, but strained. “We need something of yours.”</p><p>“What do you want?” I called back. </p><p>“Your map,” another voice called out. Feminine, but older than us.</p><p> “We lost ours. You guys look like you know where you’re going.” A third voice called out. Another boy, but this one was younger than the other two. “I’m sure you’ll figure out the way from here.”</p><p>The fourth one stayed quiet, furthest from the torchlight. I stayed weary of that one, he could easily slip into the shadows of night.</p><p>“I’ll have to refuse, not our problem you lost yours.” I shot out.</p><p>The first voice handed his torch to the girl beside him and jumped down the rock, sword at the ready. I unsheathed my own, letting the blade do the talking.</p><p>“Then we’ll have to take it.” He said matter-of-factly.</p><p>He was clearly visible in the firelight then, a head taller than me, broader in the shoulders, perhaps seventeen or eighteen. His face was gaunt, cheeks hollow from days without proper food, but his grip on the sword was steady. This wasn’t his first tussle.</p><p>He had a pugnacious look about him, his eyes were already flicking to the rest of the group, planning some strategy, the others in his group dropped down beside him. I stood my ground, on the opposite end of the campfire.</p><p>His eyes flicked past me to the figures behind. Tommy, still holding his bow. A smirk tugged at the older boy's mouth.</p><p>“Stubby, that you back there?” He started laughing, “Shit, if you’re the brains of the group, then this’ll be easier than I thought.”</p><p>Tommy’s jaw tightened, but didn’t respond.</p><p>“What does that leave you as?” He pointed his long blade straight toward me.</p><p>“Protection.”</p>"

      "content": "<p>I leaped to the left, careful to isolate the man in front of me, leaving his group behind him. The campfire on our side, still smoldering, its flames racing in the dark. </p><p>“You won’t beat me.” I said.</p><p>I got into stance, pulling the blade outstretched beside my head, my other arm reaching its length. I saw his expression change, unease etched across his face. Father always told me to unarm before resorting to maiming or going for the kill. This one before me was no threat. I had never killed a man, and I did not want to over a bloody map. But a little fear would do him good.</p><p>He struck first, wide arching slashes with a surprising amount of power, each one easy to deflect, and left an easy opening for a counterattack. I feinted once, to see how he would react, he hardly noticed, he was too focused on his own raging strikes.</p><p>I let him tire himself out, keeping an eye on the others. Would the others jump in? If they did, I’d need to make it quick. The rest of his group looked confused, as if they hadn’t expected us to actually fight. Were they stalling for the other group? Regardless, it was clear I needed to end the fight fast.</p><p>He grunted with each strike, sweat beads  lined his forehead. He stepped back to create some distance between us, and took a second to breathe and wipe the sweat off. </p><p>“Finish him already,” one of his teammates called out—the girl holding the torch. Her voice was tight with nerves.</p><p>\"He's toying with you, Garrett,\" another said, the smaller one to her left.</p><p>Garett grunted in response, “I’ve got this,” more to himself than the others.</p><p>The fourth stayed silent, still half-hidden in shadow.</p><p>I shifted my grip on the sword, enough stalling.</p><p>His next strike came tighter, angled for my arms, I quickly parried the attack, putting force behind it—his blade rang out and his grip faltered. He shouted in frustration but I closed the distance between us fast, ducking under his late swing. A quick knee to the liver and a hook to the jaw was all it took. Hard enough to hurt, but not break anything.</p><p>The sword fell from his grip, hitting the snow with a muffled thud.</p><p>He stumbled back, one hand clutching his head, the other his side, gasping for air desperately.</p><p>I quickly picked up his forsaken blade, ready for whoever came next.</p><p>“I warned you,” I shouted, loud enough for whoever was in the treeline behind us. “Now you’ve lost your sword and your map. Take your losses and head back.”</p><p>“We can still take them,” The girl hissed at Garrett, but Garrett couldn’t think straight, he simply stumbled into the rock and collapsed into the snow.</p><p>She didn’t wait for a response. Her sword scraped free of its sheath and she lunged—not at me, but past me, towards Mirvel. </p><p>She made it hardly two steps before a loud <em>whoosh</em> whizzed past me. The arrow took her right in the shoulder. </p><p>She screamed—sharp and high. “I’ve been shot! I’ve been … shot! Do something, get him!” she begged the other two.”</p><p>Tommy was already knocking another arrow, his face set. “Anyone else?” He called out, aiming his beetle bow at the other two, pointing rapidly at each of them.</p><p>The first lights of dawn were creeping over the horizon by then. The flank should have come by then, Jorik wasn’t even watching the back, his eyes were muddled with fear as he looked at the horrid scene around the fire. </p><p>The last two had their bows ready, but they were outnumbered. </p><p>“It didn’t need to come to this,” I said, pointing both swords toward them. “You can still walk away, just call off your flank.”</p><p>“What flank?” The fourth one finally yelled out.</p><p>I didn’t lower my blades. “I heard another group in the treeline. Either yours, or another group watching all of this.\" I gestured toward the treeline. \"Either way, you're done. Two of you left standing, and whoever's out there is fresh.\"</p><p>The smaller one’s eyes darted between us and the shadows behind. Fear painted a new shade of pale on his stricken face. </p><p>Silence, except for the girl’s whimpering. Garrett still hadn’t moved.</p><p>“We’re leaving,” he finally decided, voice shaking. “Just let us take them and our stuff.”</p><p>“No, we keep the blade, and your arrows, drop them now,” Mirvel said.</p><p>“But—” the small one started.</p><p>“No buts, or you get an arrow in your back,” Tommy asked grimly, pointing the bow aggressively toward the kid.</p><p>“Drop all your arrows next to the fire and leave,” I repeated.</p><p>So they did, the two helped the girl up. Garrett finally got up, a dour look on his long face. He should’ve planned better, known better,  <em>fought</em> better.</p><p>When they finally left, I tried to listen for the other set of footsteps, or any odd rustling, but whoever had been out there, was long gone. </p><p>Two days later we reached the southern base of Kael. After the encounter with Garrett’s group, we preferred to move in the early hours of the morning, and be better prepared for encounters at night. </p><p>The days blurred together, we walked until our legs burned, setting snares at each camp, rationing what food we had while Jorik's traps kept us from starving entirely. For water, we’d melt snow or drink from whatever streams hadn’t frozen over yet. Occasionally we’d see the other groups in the distance, but both sides kept clear—none of us were eager for another fight. The weather worsened as we reached the base, even our thickest layers felt like nothing against the thick winds. </p><p>Kael was a mountain that stood alone, valleys on all sides, connecting to other mountains. I looked up at the snow-capped peak and wondered what awaited us up there. Was there something to take back, showing proof of completion? I could only wonder.</p><p>I picked up the young deer, carefully removing the arrow from behind its shoulder. In just the last few days, I’d learnt how to use the beetle bow, through hunting and practice at camps. Despite that, no one got better results than Jorik. The scrawny boy had proved himself useful, keeping us all fed with his snares and traps. </p><p>But this was the biggest find we’d had since we got into the mountains. I dragged the carcass back to camp where Jorik was already working on a pair of dead rabbits from his morning traps. His eyes widened when he saw the deer.</p><p>“Where’d you find that?” He asked, eyes wide.</p><p>“Not far, small creek behind that hill.” I dropped it in front of him. “Can you handle something this size?”</p><p>“Uhh, sure, but get started on draining the blood like I showed you,” Jorik said softly, back to working on the rabbits. “Something this size, the blood needs to be drained fully or the meat’ll spoil faster.”</p><p>I grunted in response, this wasn’t the part I enjoyed. The thrill of the hunt was what excited me. To track the animal, to chase it through the forests, tracking its prints, its smell. To wait, imperturbably, for the target to settle down, to believe it is safe, and then let loose the arrow. </p><p>But dressing it was an important skill to learn. I rolled the deer onto its back and got to it, made a clean cut to drain the blood, careful not to let my knife slip too deep and puncture the gut. One mistake and we'd spoil half the meat.</p><p>“Where are Tommy and Mirvel?” I asked, watching the dark blood seep into the snow.</p><p>“They went scouting, I think—for a camp,” he said quickly. “Don’t want to get ambushed again, right?.”</p><p>“Good.” I replied, moving the carcass from the bloody snow. “We need to start planning our route up the mountain when they’re back.”</p><p>\"You're good at this,\" I continued, watching him work.</p><p>Jorik shrugged, not looking up. \"It's all I know how to do.\"</p><p>“Where’d you learn?”</p><p>His hands paused a moment, a small tremble passed through them. He dropped the knife and balled his fists, “My master. ‘Fore I came here. He'd take me hunting when I was young—not for sport, for food. Said I was too small for real work, but I could handle this.\"</p><p>He continued, “He used to beat me if I’d mess up, wasted any meat. ‘Every scrap matters when you’re ‘ungry,’ he’d say. Then he’d eat most of it anyway while he left me the scraps.”</p><p>I didn’t know how to respond to that, how to comfort him.</p><p>“He’s dead now, died a year ago. Left me to the streets, I guess that’s when Faux found me wandering.” He looked up at me with bitter eyes, “Turns out I’m still too small—too weak—for real work.”</p><p>\"It's kept us alive. That's more than most people's skills can say.\"</p><p>He paused, just for a second, then kept working. But I caught the small smile.</p><p>“Could you … show me how you set up the snares for the rabbits?” I asked. “It’s a useful skill, and I'd rather not rely entirely on arrows when we're higher up. Game might be scarcer.\"</p><p>Jorik looked up surprised, “You… want me to teach you?” </p><p>“Yeah. Unless you want to keep it a secret.” I smiled back.</p><p>He wiped his hands on the snow, cleaning off the blood. \"No, I just—most people don't care to learn. They think it's...\" he trailed off.</p><p>\"Beneath them?\"</p><p>\"Something like that.\"</p><p>I shook my head. “I may know how to fight, but if I can’t feed myself, I’d be dead before the fight.”</p><p>His smile grew a little wider. \"It's not complicated. Just takes patience.\" He stood, brushing snow from his knees. \"I'll show you after we finish here. Need to check the snares I set this morning anyway—you can help me reset them.\"</p><p>\"Deal.\"</p><p>“I’m worried about the Trial,” Jorik started quietly.</p><p>“Why? We’ve been doing well so far,” I nudged him softly.</p><p>“I don’t want to go back,” he started. “To the streets—I mean. To being nothing.” he added quickly.</p><p>I looked at him. Really looked at him. Even then he second-guessed himself. He’d kept us all fed, knew every plant and trap, worked twice as hard as anyone else and still apologized when he spoke.</p><p>“You’re not nothing, Jorik. You’re the reason we’re not starving. I’m not that good at hunting, got lucky with that deer,” I nodded towards the carcass. “We’ll make it through. All of us.”</p><p>He nodded at me, “Thanks Rand’ar.”</p><p>We worked in silence for a few minutes before the sound of footsteps crunching snow in the distance grabbed my attention.</p><p>It was another group. I saw them coming up over the hill, they must have been following the blood trail from the deer I’d killed. I should’ve been more careful, drained the blood right there and then.</p><p>They waved from afar before they came close, hands raised and open. I put my hand on my blade, still sheathed, Garrett's one also hanging on my belt. \"Easy—we're not looking for trouble!\" They called out.</p><p>“What are you looking for then?” I shouted back. Beside me, Jorik was shaking, his beetle bow on the ready.</p><p>“An alliance,” one of the others called out as they walked closer. He looked around us, “Although, I don’t see the rest of your team.”</p><p>“They’ll be here soon.” I sure hoped they did. </p><p>Alliance? For what? We were doing fine on our own. </p><p>“How many groups are still out there?” I called back.</p><p>“Not sure, but we’ve heard the climb ahead is brutal. Groups fighting over whatever game there is up there.” The one who stood ahead said—their leader. They seemed more prepared than Garrett’s group, after all, they’d made it this far. </p><p>They were finally in view proper. Four males, they looked decently fed but tired.  Their leader was tall and lean, maybe sixteen, with sharp eyes that kept sneaking glances at our supplies. The one beside him was stockier, a thick wool coat made him look even broader. The other two hung back, one had his bow gloved on his hand, but no arrow nocked, the last one was smaller, younger perhaps, constantly scanning the treeline as if he expected an ambush.</p><p>“Twin blades, is that you?” The leader asked, his face animated, like a child meeting their hero. </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“We’d heard rumours, you took down Garrett’s squad, yea?” He said, pointing to the two blades at my belt.</p><p>“Oh. Yes, we did. They tried robbing us—didn’t work out too well for them.”</p><p>“Definitely didn’t, they looked like shit from what I heard. Heard Melissa was one foot in the grave.” The stocky one piped up.</p><p>“She shouldn’t have tried fighting us after Garrett got embarrassed,” A voice rang out behind me—Tommy’s, they were back.</p><p>Mirvel stumbled through the snow behind him, carrying fresh timber. He had a skeptical look about him and fingered his sheathe. I shook my head toward him ever so slightly. These guys didn’t look aggressive, they didn’t look like they were trying to start something, it was best to remain skeptical and keep an eye out. Besides if they had information for what lay ahead, might as well hear them out.</p><p>“Aye, Sure as hell shouldn’t have, twin blades here would’ve cut her up,” the stocky one said, nodding toward me and catching my eye. He had an unnerving look about him that I didn’t like, a hunger for more than food.</p><p>“What exactly are you proposing?” I asked, cutting the chatter short. “Make the climb together or just watch each other’s backs on the way up?”</p><p>“Nothing so formal, just look out for each other on the way up you know? Share game and all that,” the tall one said.</p><p>I didn’t like that, he was being vague, he wanted something else, he wanted more, and I wasn’t sure what it was. </p><p>“Besides, we already know each other, or at least me and Tommy go way back,” He continued, smiling widely, “Mirvel, you too, right? We've snuck past curfew together more than once. Remember that night we broke into the storage for extra rations? Orem nearly caught us.\"</p><p>Tommy grinned despite himself. \"Barely made it out. Good thing Zach was on lookout.\" He said, nodding toward the small, jumpy one.</p><p>\"Exactly. We look out for each other, always have.\" The tall one said, patting the younger one’s head, like an older brother might. He spread his hands. \"That's all I'm asking for here. Same thing, different mountain.\"</p><p>“We need a moment to discuss. Stay there,” I said to them.</p><p>The tall one put his hands up in surrender, as he backed away, “Of course, of course, take your time. We’ll be all the way here.” </p><p>“I know these guys, we go way back. I say we—” Tommy started.</p><p>“I don’t like it,” Jorik jumped in, shaking his head. “Not one bit.”</p><p>“Who asked you?” Tommy glared at him.</p><p>“Nah I agree with him,” I said, gloving my bow. “They’re being pushy, what was that whole thing about sneaking past curfew, why’d he bring that up?” </p><p>“Yeah,  besides, we’ve been doing fine up till now just us,” Mirvel insisted. “But if the climb really is as brutal as they say, and groups are fighting over resources up there, more numbers might mean the difference  between if we make it or not.”</p><p>“More numbers means more mouths to feed, and we’ve been doing fine on our own. I saw how they were eyeing our stuff, it didn’t look good. What do they offer besides numbers?” I asked.</p><p>“Protection for one. See Kadar?”</p><p>“Who?” Jorik asked.</p><p>“The big one. He was a pit fighter before he came here. Used to wrestle for his master's entertainment. Broke a man's arm in three places once, bare-handed. If we run into trouble, having him on our side isn't nothing,\" Tommy said, punching the air in front of him.</p><p>“Great, so he’s strong enough to take down any of us if he gets close enough. Then why do they need us?” I asked.</p><p>“Look Rand’ar, I agree we should be suspicious, but we can’t just stay huddled up alone the whole way up. Everyone else’ll got allies on the mountain, we’ll need ‘em too,” Mirvel said.</p><p>He paused, matching me in the eye, “But you get the final say. You saved us back there with Garrett’s squad, and if we get into another fight, it’ll have to be you again.”</p><p>I wanted to say no. They were inviting us with nostalgia of old, bonds that once ran. But in the mountains, none of that matters, none of it matters as you lay buried in the snow, a frozen corpse, killed for the smallest disagreement. </p><p>I could see a look of wistfulness in Tommy’s eyes, fearful longing for home in Mirvel’s, they just wanted to make it out alive. Jorik’s hands twisted in his sleeves as his eyes darted between our group and theirs, desperate for someone to make the decision for him. </p><p>Mirvel was watching me, Tommy too. Waiting for the final call. Behind them, Rhen’s group stood ready, confident I’d say yes.</p><p>I was risking the mission either way really. To me, all that mattered was proving myself to Astaron, and keeping us alive. </p><p>I took a deep sigh, still unsure, but I had to make a decision. They all looked to me for it.</p><p>“Fine, but we keep our distance, we still keep watch for our own group, but if anything happens, we’ll fight with them.” I said, with uncertain finality.</p><p>Tommy and Mirvel nodded in approval, but Jorik’s face was blank. </p><p>“Alright,” I called out to the other group. “We’ll ally with you.”</p><p>“Great.” The tall one clapped his hands together, a warm smile on his face, “We've got another group we've been traveling with, they're camped about a mile east. Eight of us total climbing together.\"</p><p><em>Eight</em>. The number hit me like a fist. Eight of them total, and only four of us. I’d weighed whether we could take them four on four, but with eight of them, <em>maybe</em> I could make it out, but the rest wouldn't. I'd just walked us into a position where we were completely outnumbered, surrounded by people I didn't know or trust. And I'd done it because Tommy smiled at an old friend. </p><p>I looked around, Tommy and Mirvel only looked delighted at hearing it, the more the merrier they must've thought. Only Jorik seemed to share my suspicions.</p><p><em>Eight</em>. The number settled like a swallowed spear in my gut, twisting and churning. We were fucked if things went wrong.</p><p><a id=\"_p99ulfwm394d\"></a></p>"

      "content": "<p>It was loud, and my head begged to be split open. Twelve people meant twelve voices, twelve sets of footsteps, twelve heartbeats I couldn't shut out. I saw Tommy laugh with them all like they’d been friends for years. I sat apart, far removed from them all, watching. </p><p>They sat there, laughing and munching on that doe I had hunted. It was meant for the climb, but the other groups pressured us to share it.</p><p>“<em>We’re all allies now, right? What’s the point of rationing when we’ve got fresh meat right here? Might as well feast while we can, ain’t nothing good gonna be up there. Nothing at all!</em>” Kadar had said and Tommy had been quick to oblige. </p><p>I needed to get a word in to him, he’d been too trusting, too social with them. I tried to catch his eye, he looked back, chewing on the cooked venison, but he didn’t get my meaning. He turned back to the centre of attention.</p><p>\"—so there I was,\" Rhen—the tall leader—said, hands gesturing widely, \"halfway up that tower in the Gauntlet in the dead of night. Fifty feet up, freezing, thinking 'I'm finally gonna see what Astaron's hiding.' Then I hear—'Rhen, you absolute fucking idiot'—and it's Hurbasa, just standing there watching me dangle.\"</p><p>\"Did Orem find out?\" someone asked.</p><p>\"I'm getting to it. So I'm hanging there, then I hear Astaron—'What are you doing up there, boy?' The old man himself.\"</p><p>Someone groaned sympathetically.</p><p>\"So I panic and yell down, 'Lord Astaron! Checking the tower's structural integrity! For safety!' Dead silence. Then Astaron says, 'In the middle of the night. In your underclothes.' Because I'd stripped down to climb faster.\"</p><p>The group burst out laughing.</p><p>\"So there I am, basically naked, freezing my balls off, and then I start sliding. Can't grip anymore. I'm cheese-grating myself down this tower, land right on my ass in front of both of them. Astaron looks at my scraped-up chest and says, 'Next time, wear some bloody pants.'\"</p><p>The camp roared. Even some of my group were grinning.</p><p>\"Never told Orem. But Hurbasa? Every time he sees me, he just smirks.\"</p><p>Imbeciles, the lot of them. I couldn’t bear the blasting laughter, so I slipped away. The headaches were getting worse each day, the sounds more irritating. I sat down at the foot of a large tree, far enough to just barely make out the camp’s voices. </p><p>My brain pounced at my skull behind my eyes, and in my desperation, I tried to rub my head against the tree trunk to calm the electrifying pain—it didn’t help.</p><p>I only heard the footsteps when they’d come right up to me. I looked around for the source in my dizzy state. It was Kalandyr, how long had he been standing there? How on Nerva was he there?</p><p>“Been having headaches, hmm? The sounds bother you more than they should, don't they?” He asked.</p><p>I didn’t understand, he was supposed to be back at the compound. But the second set of footsteps suddenly made sense—back at the standoff with Garrett, and in the days that followed, but how come only I’d heard them?</p><p>“I once had them too,” he leaned in, “Till I learned how to control them.”</p><p>“Why are you here? Have you been following me?” I asked.</p><p>“Oh no. No, you’re not that important alone. See, I’m a Watcher. What?” He asked, looking at my puzzled face. </p><p>“You think we let you all out here alone, to plunder and kill each other as you please,” he rolled up a ball of snow, throwing it as far as he could. “We make sure things don’t go too far out of hand, keep the Trial from turning into a massacre. Otherwise?\" He shrugged. \"We watch.\"</p><p>“What if I don’t need your watching? What if I told you to fuck off?”</p><p>Kalandyr grinned at that, “You could try. But then I’d have to report that the son of Haestus was being hostile. Astaron would certainly be interested to hear that.” He threw another ball of snow into the long dark. “Besides, I was going easy on you that day,” he exhaled with an irritating laugh.</p><p>“Keep my father’s name off your tongue. What do <em>you</em> know about him?” I demanded, rubbing my temples with my knuckles.</p><p>“Nothing really, I’ve just… heard some things.” </p><p>“You said you had the headaches once too, how’d you get rid of them?” I asked, desperate to be rid of them. They’d started the day I talked to Astaron, and only got worse with the passing nights. I hadn’t slept properly in days. The fatigue had caught up to me.</p><p>“Weren’t you just telling me to fuck off?” He chuckled with a dry humourless air. But then his voice turned weighty, “The sounds, the headaches—they’ll keep getting worse before they get better, don’t let it break you before then.”</p><p>“That’s it then. I know you know more, but you’re keeping it from me.”</p><p>He grinned at that, putting a finger to his mouth, “I’ll tell you one thing for now. The sounds, the details, you see more than the others do, focus on the elements you need. Make it back alive from the Trial, and I’ll answer one question about what’s happening to you.” </p><p>He started walking away after that, but I called out to him.</p><p>“So it happened to you too? The Ab—”</p><p>“It did—don’t say <em>that</em> out loud.” He hushed me. “It’s a cursed thing, don’t speak of it out here,” he shivered at the thought. </p><p><em>Cursed</em>. I mulled the word over in my mouth, it dug around like a cold, sharp hook, prickly. Cursed, he’d said. Was that what had happened to me?</p><p>And with that, he was gone, disappeared back into the greys and whites of the mountains, all blending together with the wind.</p><p>I sat there for a long moment, my sword propped up beside me on the tree trunk. So there were people controlling the Trial. I wondered if they’d had to jump in yet in some corner of the mountain, perhaps to put down the dark tendencies of someone. </p><p>All those times I’d heard footsteps, just barely, I wasn’t dreaming it. It’s like seeing something at the edge of the peripheral, can’t be sure, but my gut told me it happened. It must’ve been Kalandyr all along, but why? For whatever reason, he was watching me specifically.</p><p>He didn’t seem to know much about Father, so it couldn’t have been to see the son of Haestus. He knew what was happening to me. The sounds, the headaches, the overwhelming sensory flood. He'd experienced it too. Called it <em>cursed</em>. </p><p>I returned to the camp as the groups settled in for the night, each turned toward their own packs, huddled around their own smaller fires. Tommy caught my eye, gestured to the spot they'd saved for me. I sat, said nothing about where I'd been.</p><p>Rhen’s group had set up their bedrolls close to ours, too close. We were one camp, sure, but we were still three groups. </p><p>I didn’t sleep well that night, not at all, plagued by nightmares of a tree wrapping around my lifeless body and squeezing while Kalandyr watched laughing. It kept going till I woke up in a sweat. </p><p>The climb got exponentially worse as we went further up, starting off gradually till we were on our hands and knees trying to crawl up to avoid being swept by the terrorizing winds. </p><p>The snow poured down on us, dropping any and all visibility to nothing. I only saw the whites and greys swirl together in front of my eyes as I clung on to the ragged rock. </p><p>A scream cut through the wind—high and terrified. Jorik.</p><p>I turned, squinting through the snow, almost losing my footing. I couldn’t see him, couldn’t see anything.</p><p>Kadar pushed past me, his massive silhouette pressed against the bleakness, toward where the scream had come from. I followed, grabbing onto the rope that connected us all.</p><p>At the end of it, Jorik was dangling off the edge, eyes wide with terror, one hand gripping the ice, the other flailing. Behind him a white void stretched on endlessly. My feet drifted toward the edge before I’d realized, tugged at my chest, like the Abyss had. While I was in my haze, Kadar didn’t hesitate. He dropped to his stomach and reached down toward Jorik.</p><p>I snapped out of it, my hand trembled over the grip of my sword. Was he—?</p><p>Kadar reached down and grabbed Jorik's wrist with both hands. \"I've got you! Stop thrashing!\"</p><p>He heaved, muscles straining, but he couldn’t with just a one arm grip. I reached down beside him. </p><p>“Jorik, grab my hand!” I screamed down toward him, praying the words weren’t drowned out by the storm.</p><p>I lunged for Jorik’s arm mid-swing and grabbed firmly. “Pull with me at once!” I screamed toward Kadar, he hadn’t noticed me going for my blade.</p><p>“NOW!” He bellowed. We pulled, my muscles strained till I thought my biceps might pop, the tendons threatened to burst. But slowly, inch by blasted inch, we pulled Jorik up to safe ground.</p><p>“Easy, easy,” Kadar said, surprisingly gentle for the big brute.</p><p>I embraced Jorik, the tears had frozen on his face. I patted him on the back, “Stay ahead of me for the rest of the way, alright? I’ll keep the back.” </p><p>Tommy clapped Kadar on the shoulder, “Good catch.”</p><p>He grinned at me and whispered in my ear, sparing a careful glance at Jorik, “See, I told you we could trust these guys.”</p><p>I stood there, shame burning through the cold. My arm had reached for my blade faster than I could think. What the hell had I been thinking?</p><p>Could we really trust these guys? I pondered. There was no reason for Kadar to help Jorik if they planned to turn on us. If anything it’d be an easy way to turn it into an eight on three. I had to learn to trust them, open my mind to the possibility that not everyone was out for my throat. </p><p>“Best we stop here till the storm lets out a bit,” Rhen called out from the front.</p><p>“Agreed,” someone from the other group said.</p><p>We were in a good spot, the outcropping protected us from the fierce wind. But we didn’t have the food to stay too long, we’d already been rationing on the way up. We hunted in the early parts of the climb, but game had disappeared entirely once the true ascension began.</p><p>The storm didn’t let up entirely but it certainly slowed down, and I pushed for us to keep moving. Sooner we made it up, the sooner we’d make it back down. </p><p>The winds pushed against us like a wall, and the mountain loomed ahead of us, challenging us to make the climb. The peak remained hidden behind grey clouds, but I could feel we were close, in my bones. Perhaps it was just the frigid air biting me.</p><p>We moved slower as a group but by the second morning we’d reached the clouds. The foggy landscape mingled with the blues of the clouds.</p><p>We huddled close around the spent fire, fingers chasing desperately for whatever warmth remained.</p><p>“My cousin did the trial two years ago, said there’s ten flags, and we’ve gotta make it back to the Gauntlet with one. Ten flags, twenty groups,” Luca broke the silence, one of the kids from the other group.</p><p>“Great, so we’re fucked from the start,” Rhen groaned. The words came quickly—too quickly, before Luca even finished speaking. Like he’d been waiting to say them.</p><p>“We should grab all the flags that are left, even if there’s more than three—fuck the other groups up,” Kadar grinned, looking at Rhen. </p><p>“My cousin also told me there’s proctors,” Luca continued, “‘Watchers’ he’d called ‘em, said they step in if anyone does what they’re not supposed—”</p><p>“Hell’s that mean, <em>not supposed to</em>, they didn’t tell us any rules at the start,” Tommy chimed in.</p><p>“And where’ve these ‘Watchers’ been? We ain’t seen ‘em yet,” Zach piped up, the jumpy one from Rhen’s group.</p><p>“Fuck you tryna say? My cousin’s a liar?” Luca shot back.</p><p>“Easy, Luca, he’s just saying they don’t seem to be around, maybe we’ll see one up top,” Rhen hurried in. Oh but they are around, I thought. Kalandyr might’ve been watching us from afar, nestled in a mound of snow, carefully following our tracks. </p><p>Their bickering continued, I simply tuned out the noise and studied the map for the rest of our path up. </p><p>We continued up, my legs ached, each step a footfall in deep snow. The wind pushed down on us, each gust threatening to rip us off the mountain. Despite the gloves, my hands were numb, fingers strangled by the terrible winds. Just when Tommy was groaning about how he couldn’t go on much further, the wind stopped.</p><p>Not gradually, just a sudden stop. A serene quiet surrounded us, the clouds had disappeared. I lifted my head up—clear sky, bright sun—barely past its zenith. The storm below us roared on, muffled and distant.</p><p>We’d broken through the clouds.</p><p>The ridge ahead of us was clear of snow and a shallow climb, the peak ahead beckoning us to come.</p><p>We shimmied through the narrow ridge. I took the lead, grabbing fistfuls of rock, careful to keep my eyes forward and not glance at the sheer drop to my side. My foot almost slipped, a loose rock tumbled down the side—I didn’t hear it hit the bottom.</p><p>The summit came into view as the sun bore down on us, suddenly warmer than it had been below. I hadn’t realized my face was slick with sweat. </p><p>We reached the top with nothing to greet us except the flat expanse of rock and snow, and the screeching wind. </p><p>We were the first to arrive—it looked like, no prints in the snow. Or so I thought, until I saw the flags.</p><p>Two lone flags, planted deep in the snow, their fabric flapping viciously in the wind.</p><p>Two flags. Three groups. </p>"

      "content": "<p>I heard Rhen’s sharp intake of breath behind me. </p><p>“Alright, so here’s how—” before he even finished, I’d already slipped away to the flags. </p><p>“Slow down twin blades, there’s three groups and two flags. I’d reckon we did most of the heavy lifting to get up here. Me, Luca, and our boys. Your group just tagged along.”</p><p>“Didn’t you come asking <em>us</em> for an alliance?” Tommy asked.</p><p>“Shut your goddamn mouth,” Kadar growled, he licked his lips, hunger in his eyes.</p><p>While they talked, I’d yanked both flags from where they’d been buried, snow gushing out with them. I held my arms out to my sides for all to see.</p><p>“Now listen Rand’ar—” My mind was moving fast, I felt clarity in my thoughts like I hadn’t for weeks. “—there’s eight of us and four of you. Maths pretty clear on who—”</p><p>My body moved faster than my thoughts, I could feel the excitement, the adrenaline coursing through my blood. The math <em>was</em> pretty clear, it didn’t work, but I controlled the equation. It had to be there and then, I pulled one flag close, inhaled deeply and flung it with all the lifeblood within me—flung it far over the edge. </p><p>The flag was lost to the white void, never to be seen again.</p><p>“And now there are four of us each,” I called out calmly, holding the last flag up for them all to see.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?!” Luca pulled out his blade, his group followed.</p><p>I looked behind me, it was a steep drop, but padded with snow. I could make it. </p><p>The closest one to me was Zach. Tommy, Mirvel, and Jorik were at the back of the group. </p><p>Zach stared at me with his mouth agape, and a devious idea passed through my head. </p><p>Before I’d thought it through, I unsheathed one of my blades and put my sword to his neck.</p><p>“Any of you come closer, I’ll gut him,” I bluffed, blade aimed at Zach’s throat.</p><p>Rhen finally caught some sense, his hand went to his sword. “You wouldn’t—”</p><p>“Tommy!” I called out to the back. “The ridge—get down! Now!”</p><p>Tommy moved without hesitation, he pulled Mirvel down the descent with him. Jorik hesitated, stunned, he peeked over the ridge and froze.</p><p>“Move Jorik! Now!” Too late. Kadar lunged for him. Fuck, I needed to split them all up. Seven on one weren’t good odds. I hoped the insanity of it would make my pursuers think twice. I took one last look at the waning hill below, boulders riddled the path. A dangerous gambit, no doubt, but a risk I was willing to take.</p><p>I pulled Zach close, sheathed my sword and jumped—slipped rather—off the edge. I held tight onto both the flag and Zach, my tickets back to The Gauntlet. </p><p>We tumbled through fresh powder, the world spinning whites and mottled greys. Snow forced its way into my lungs, sending me into a coughing fit. We kept rolling, faster and out of control. Zach’s elbow caught my ribs, sending the wind out of me. Another impact, my hip against stone, sent a flaring line of pain up my side. The flag tangled around my arm, tried to rip itself free. But I gripped tighter, refused to let go as we tumbled endlessly down. </p><p>Only by the Hand of the Light or whatever higher force had taken me from my home kept me alive as we rolled down that sharp decline. It steered our path down, free of boulders, but not free of hurt entirely.</p><p>We rolled violently to a stop against a withering tree, spasms of white hot pain shooting up my spine. I coughed out the last of the snow while Zach moaned beside me.</p><p>I pushed myself up, “You hurt?”</p><p>“What do you care?” He snapped back, massaging his legs.</p><p>“Look, I don’t want to hurt you—so long as you work with me here. I just need Rhen to play along with our little game,” I inspected the flag, miraculously no rips on it. I still had my sword and bow. “You think Rhen’ll trade you for Jorik?”</p><p>He shot me the finger in response, still on the ground.</p><p>“Right, I’m gonna need your weapons and your compass—matter of fact, throw me your whole pack.” I pointed my blade at him, “Do it.”</p><p>I made him bury his things in the snow, save the rope which I held onto, and we began trudging through the sparse trees. The storm was calmer on the North side of Kael, its violent fury focused on ravaging the Southern side. </p><p>We continued in the general direction of The Gauntlet—North West, with only a compass to guide us. Zach tried to make a run for it twice, but he was no runner, and I caught him fast both times, threatening to take off a finger if he tried it again. </p><p>The descent down Kael was arduous, sparse with game, devoid of protection and lone of other groups. I suppose that was a good thing. We treaded down during the early hours of the morning and just before sunfall, times when other groups would be sleeping or making camp. At night, I tied Zach with a rope, bound to a tree while I kept watch.</p><p>I wondered where Tommy and Mirvel were, they jumped down the ridge right next to us, yet we never encountered them. I could only pray that they made it down safe.</p><p>My mind kept wandering to Jorik. He’d been wary of the others all along—I doubted he even fully trusted us. He was up there with Rhen and Kadar—if they'd even kept him alive. My gut twisted at the thought. I should’ve made sure he jumped with us, grabbed him if I needed to. But I’d been focused on the flag, getting away. Now Jorik was paying for my choices. </p><p>It took us an entire day to realize we were lost, with no map to guide us, we’d surrendered to the whims of nature. The compass kept us moving in the general direction sure, but without a planned route, we might end up somewhere else entirely. The mountains all looked the same, white slopes, dark rock, sparse trees. No landmarks that I recognized from our climb up. This was foreign land, we’d taken another path entirely.</p><p>By midday, I spotted movement through the trees below. Three figures, moving southeast. Another group.</p><p>I pulled Zach behind a tree. “Not a word,” I hissed, “You want to make it back alive right? Cause right now we're lost.”</p><p>I quickly buried the flag and my second blade beneath a twisted tree, marking the spot in my head. </p><p>“What now?” Zach whispered.</p><p>“Now we’re lost and desperate,” I put up my hands in surrender and called out. “Hey! We need help!”</p><p>“Stay there! What do you need?” One of them called out. “And where’s the rest of your group?”</p><p>“Got separated, they’ve got our map. We’re just looking for directions back to the compound, no problems.”</p><p>They showed us the route back to The Gauntlet, North through a valley, then East. We thanked them and headed on our way. </p><p>As we travelled toward the valley, our route became populated with hunt. Real food we hadn’t had in days. I managed to bring down a hare with my bow, and we ate it half cooked over a small fire, too weak to wait. The trees grew denser as we passed through the valley, providing cover from the wind. Zach even stopped glaring at me long enough to admit the direction looked right, we’d clear the valley by nightfall at this pace. For the first time since the summit, I let myself believe it was possible—that we’d make it back, that I’d see Tommy and Mirvel again. That I’d proven myself after all. I looked at the flag flapping in my hands, and the smallest of smiles creeped on my face. </p><p>Then I saw it before I heard them.</p><p>A small sunken boy standing on the edge of the clearing, a sword pointed to his neck. Jorik. </p><p>Rhen stood on the other end of that sword, an intense look in his eyes. Kadar stood beside him, his bow gloved. </p><p>Before I’d taken another step, I pulled out my sword and held it to Zach’s chest. “Just play along,” I whispered in his ear. “Tell him to trade. You for Jorik.”</p><p>“This has gone far enough, twin blades.” Rhen called across the no man's land that stretched between us. The wind swept around us, rustling the tree branches, leaving an eerie effect.</p><p>“Give us the flag, or I swear I’ll cut his throat,” he pushed the blade just deep enough to make Jorik’s neck bleed. Jorik shut his eyes, tears sliding down his face. His lips quivered—prayers, barely audible over the wind.</p><p>“I won that flag. Duel me for it, if your blade rings true,” I said.</p><p>“That was a smart move you made back there with the flag, and it would’ve worked, had this one run with you,” he kicked Jorik in the legs, bringing him to his knees.</p><p>I grabbed Zach by the hood and yanked him to the floor, my blade pressed to his ribs. “You kill him, I kill yours. Then I kill you anyway. You’ve lost.”</p><p>“Rand’ar please, give him the flag.” Jorik’s voice cracked, barely above a whisper. “It’s not worth it. We can—look for the other flag—or anything, please.” His breath hitched. “Please, I don’t want to die unworthy...”</p><p>Damn that Astaron, there was no one more worthy of freedom among us than Jorik. He couldn’t bear violence, and he’d be deemed unworthy for it. And myself, I’d fall in with him if I handed that flag over. </p><p>“Whatever the rumours might say, you can’t take the both of us,” Kadar called out.</p><p>“What rumours?” </p><p>“Haven’t heard? The Watchers made sure everyone knew about you.” Rhen answered. “Part of the trial, I figured—stir something up. Stories of you crushing Garett, sending him limping back. How you took the last flag right off the summit, how you held your own against Kalandyr and walked away.” He grinned. </p><p>“They’re calling you ‘The Fallen’ now. Fell right off the summit and kept running.” Kadar finished. </p><p>“Then you’ll know you’ve lost.” </p><p>Why were the Watchers stirring things up? Was this Kalandyr’s doing? Never mind, none of it mattered in that moment.</p><p>“I reckon we’ll take our chances, Kadar’s a real fighter,” Rhen nodded toward him. “I reckon when we’re done with you, they’ll talk about how you <em>fell</em> to my blade.”</p><p>“You take a step closer and Zach loses his head.”</p><p>Silence stretched between us. The wind died down. Everything went still. I stared into his eyes, he bared his teeth back, none of us ready to back down.</p><p>Rhen’s grip on Jorik loosened. The blade pulled back from his neck. “Alright, alright, you’ve won. We’ll trade.”</p><p>Jorik’s eyes finally opened, his prayers ceasing mid-mumble. He looked up at me, a new light shining in his eyes. I loosened up on Zach. Jorik got up and began—</p><p>The sword plunged right through Jorik’s chest, protruding out in front of him.</p><p>Jorik’s eyes went wide as he grabbed the blade. His blood splattered the soft snow in front of him. Rhen yanked his sword free.</p><p>Jorik’s face still had a smile, like his mouth told a different story than his eyes. Then he crumpled into the snow.</p><p>“No—” The word tore from my throat.</p><p>Rhen wiped Jorik’s blood in the sleeve of his arm, “Now give me that fuckin’ flag.”</p><p>My eyes scattered, to the trickling blood in the snow, to his fallen body. Jorik was dead. The skittish kid who’d finally smiled when I’d asked him to teach me. Dead in the snow over some damned flag. Rhen had killed Jorik. Deemed him unworthy.</p><p>My vision swam to Zach, still crouched on the ground, trembling. He was part of Rhen’s. He was with them. This was his fault too. He should’ve asked Rhen to trade like I’d told him to. </p><p>They needed to know, to understand. Or else, Jorik had died for nothing. An eye for an eye, it was only fair. </p><p>Rhen needed to be marked unworthy, I’d mark them all. Starting with Zach. But more than all—I needed to win. I’d been taken from my home, tortured, survived the bloody mountain and taken that flag—survived all this hell. I wasn’t going back empty-handed. I wasn’t going to be deemed unworthy like Jorik.</p><p>I was the son of Haestus, I wasn’t going to be sold as some slave. No, I was more than that. </p><p>My grip tightened around the hilt. I pulled Zach’s head from his hair, turned him to face Rhen, and before any further rationale could stop me, I swung the blade.</p><p>“Rhen—” he tried calling out.</p><p>Hot blood sprayed across my face, Zach made a wet, choking sound, his hands clawing at the heavens above. </p><p><em>Thump. Thump. Thump… </em>I heard the last beats of his heart as he tumbled down.</p><p>A wild, animal scream tore out of me.</p><p>Rhen’s eyes drifted to Zach’s fallen corpse, a new shade of cold layered his eyes. “I’m not going back. I’m NOT going back.” He whisper-screamed, more to himself than anyone.</p><p>Kadar turned to him, shaking him desperately, “This was supposed to work! Now Zach’s fucking dead because of you. You weren’t supposed to kill Jorik you fuckin’ dolt!”</p><p>Rhen heard none of it, he’d dropped to his knees, his head between his legs, laughing—crying. </p><p>“I’m not going back. Not going back to Zargon. I can’t.” He choked.</p><p>His eyes drifted to the flag still in my hands, “We can still take it. We can still be worthy Kadar!”</p><p>“Rhen the Watchers—”</p><p>“Fuck them, if they were gonna step in, they would’ve. It’s up to us to raise ourselves up.”</p><p>I put down the flag and readied my steel, Kadar did the same. He still had some semblance of sanity, unlike Rhen who charged at me blindly, swinging furiously in front of him.</p><p>Kadar came at me from my side, I pivoted, but I was caught between them.</p><p>Kadar’s first strikes came low and fast. I barely got my blade down in time, just barely pushing it down towards the snow. The impact jarred up my arm, nearly knocked the sword out of my grip. He didn’t pull back, he came at me repeatedly—another thrust, aimed at my ribs. I couldn’t bring my sword up in time, I tried to twist away, the point scraped along my side, tearing the fabric. Blood dripped down. </p><p>My hands were shaking, each parry felt heavier than the last. </p><p>Another thrust. I knocked it away with a wide arc but it forced me to step back. I grabbed my side and tried to calm my breath. </p><p>Rhen circled around me waiting for an opening, laughing maniacally.</p><p>I couldn’t keep it up, I was bleeding heavily, my side all torn up. Was I ready to give up, having been so close to learning more about my father? I asked myself. No, I wasn’t ready for that. I had a responsibility, to my siblings, to Jorik—to myself—to keep moving forward.</p><p>I took one deep breath as they both edged toward me, then I dived towards Kadar, towards his legs. He swung—too high—and I dragged my blade up his spine, dug deeper as I slashed up. A deep howl erupted from his mouth and he stumbled forward and fell, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. He twitched once, twice, then went still.</p><p><em>Thump. Thump. Thump</em>. His heart stopped its one purpose.</p><p>The manic laughing stopped as Rhen realized the situation. His eyes went wide and his hand trembled on the sword and it fell from his grip. </p><p>“WATCHERS!” He screamed, “He’s killing us! Will you just watch us all die to this monster!”</p><p>“No one’s coming for you, bastard,” I spat out. “Are you ready to meet your master? Pick up your blade and meet your end like a man.”</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the snow, next to Kadar’s corpse, the blood pooled around him. He was done, no fight left in him</p><p>“What’s the point, I’m fucked anyway—”</p><p>I swung down with all the strength that remained. It lodged deep into his neck, the blood sprayed on my hands. Rhen choked on his own blood. I brought the blade back up and swung again, his head rolled off. His headless-corpse toppled on top of Kadar.</p><p><em>Thump. Thump.</em> His heart died faster than the others.</p><p>I stood there, chest-heaving, bleeding through my side, my blade dripping with the blood of three. Zach. Kadar. Rhen.</p><p>I picked up the gore-stained flag with my other arm.</p><p>I’d made it. I was worthy. The Fallen stood for another day.</p>"

      "content": "<p>I climbed the steps of the great tower in the compound. Each step up a painful reminder of what’d been lost and what I’d gained. I was alive for one, although I was stuck in Doctor Oroya’s clinic for three nights as she patched me up after the trial.</p><p><em>Tsk. Tsk. I suspect I’ll be seeing a lot more of you here,</em> she’d said.</p><p>I’d brought her what little I could—strips of dried meat from the trial, helped her sort her supplies while I recovered. She’d waved it off but kept the meat.</p><p>Tommy and Mirvel had made it back, two whole days before me. Those bastards were fast.</p><p><em>Figured you’d died, cuz</em>, Tommy laughed.</p><p>When I told them what had happened, with Jorik, Zach and the rest, they only looked at me in horror and  didn’t talk much after.</p><p>As I mounted the last steps, I wondered if I could still make a run for it. I’d survived the Trial after all, survived through the bitter cold and made it out alive—had bested Kael. I could make it through the Belt, back to Nothello.</p><p>But I wasn't ready for that. Not with the questions about Father that haunted my dreams—questions only Astaron could answer. I still didn't know who had dragged me here, or what this curse was that Kalandyr spoke of. The Abyss, the headaches, the sounds that overwhelmed me—all of it pointed to something I didn't understand.</p><p>I needed answers before I could run.</p><p>I knocked on the wooden door to Astaron’s chambers. Once, twice, before Astaron said, “It’s open, come in.”</p><p>The smell of musk hit me before anything. His chambers were fabulous to behold, almost comparable to a Northern estaminet. Cloths of exquisite blue and light gold lined the expansive windows around the room. A deep maroon carpet covered most of the area, elegant wooden chairs set up around the desk. </p><p>The desk itself was something to behold, further accentuated by the man that sat behind it, his presence only added to the power of the room. He was writing something, dipping his quill in ink and scratching something quickly into a paper.</p><p>“Take a seat,” he said without looking up, gesturing to one of the chairs opposite him.</p><p>“I prefer to stand,” I said, hands clasped behind my back.</p><p>“You still don’t trust us, Rand’ar?” He said, finally moving the paper aside and setting his hands down on the desk.</p><p><em>Us</em>, he said. No, I didn’t trust <em>him</em>. He’d been the architect of my imprisonment, no matter how many smiles he put on now or after.</p><p>“Forgive me, Lord, for being weary after you told me I was your prisoner during our previous conversation.”</p><p>“Have you felt like a prisoner? Have you not been treated just like any other student? Did Orem or Hurbasa single you out? Tell me and I will address it.”</p><p>“I suppose not,” I admitted.</p><p>“Then sit, Rand’ar,” he pointed again towards a chair. I gave in reluctantly.</p><p>There was a long pause after, like he was waiting for something. So I broke the silence. </p><p>“You told me to prove myself—that you’d tell me about Father once I did,” I said.</p><p>“I did. First tell me about the trial.”</p><p>“You already know everything that happened,” I sneered.</p><p>“I do, but I want to hear it from you,” he replied calmly. </p><p>I shifted in my sweat, “We made it to the summit. There were only two flags for three groups. Rhen's group turned on us. Jorik was killed. I took the flag and made it back.\"</p><p>“And?”</p><p>He knew exactly what had happened.</p><p>“On the way back, I encountered Rhen’s group, had to fight them.”</p><p>“Aren’t you missing something? What happened to the boy you kidnapped?”</p><p>There was no hiding from it.</p><p>“I had to put him down,” I stammered. Suddenly the carpet below the desk was a lot more interesting.</p><p>“Had to?” his voice remained calm. \"I have 4 eyewitnesses saying you killed the boy in cold blood. He was your hostage. Rhen killed your teammate. Then what, you killed his in retaliation?\"</p><p>I said nothing, could say nothing.</p><p>\"Look at me, Rand'ar.\"</p><p>I forced my eyes up.</p><p>“You didn’t <em>have to</em> do anything. Zach was your prisoner, he was on the ground, unarmed, no threat to you. You killed him because you were angry. Why?”</p><p>“If Jorik was unworthy, then how was Zach any different? They all turned on us, he was part of them.”</p><p>“But you killed Rhen too, did you not? And Kadar? And did not report their deaths.”</p><p>“Why didn’t the Watchers step in?”</p><p>He paused for an uncomfortably long moment. The bottle clinked softly as he poured a drink, then he rose and faced the window behind him.</p><p>“The Watchers aren’t meant to intervene in every fight. They are there to watch you, see what kind of men you are out in the field,” he said, taking a long sip of his drink.</p><p>“Your father was a better man than you,” he continued plainly. “Were he in the Trial, he would’ve figured out a way to unite all the groups, to prove himself without the need of any flag. He would’ve helped the others survive.” He leaned forward on the desk, “<em>That’s</em> the kind of men I need.”</p><p>“I am not my father.” I said bitterly, staring back into his eyes.</p><p>“Are you your fathers son?”</p><p>“What kind of question is that?” </p><p>“A simple one. You claim not to be Haestus, fine. But do you carry anything of him? His principles? His judgement?” He paused, “Or is it just his name you hold.”</p><p>“Tch,” a sneer escaped me. “Who are you to question that? How do I know you even knew my father? Why would some man halfway across the world—”</p><p>“I knew your father for longer than you’ve been alive,” his voice cut through, calm and absolute, “Would you recognize his handwriting if I showed you?”</p><p>I hesitated, “I would.”</p><p>He grabbed a folder from his desk, inside was a well-preserved paper. I immediately recognized the signature at the bottom, it truly was Father’s. It read:</p><p><em>Astaron,</em></p><p><em>By the time you read this, we will be long gone. I write not to explain, explanations would take more pages than I have strength for. I write this to say farewell to an old friend who deserves more than silence.</em></p><p><em>The Withdrawal has failed, I hope you can see it in the coming time. Not in the way our enemies claimed it would, but in a way far worse. We freed bodies, yes. We broke chains of iron and returned men to themselves. But the chains that remain are woven deeper than steel, into law, into custom, into the very fabric of how power moves through this world. I thought we could change it. I was wrong.</em></p><p><em>My wife and her sister will accompany me North. Sera has asked to come, and I will not refuse her. I leave behind my brothers. One chose his path long ago, and it’s led him far from mine. The other… I pray he finds his own way to the truth. If you are able, I ask that you watch over those who remain, nothing more.</em></p><p><em>Do not look for me in the North. I do not go seeking for answers, I go because there is nothing for us to do here, and the North is far from my sins.</em></p><p><em>May the work we started continue in worthier hands.</em></p><p><em>—Haestus</em></p><p>I scanned the letter, read it three, maybe four times, like scrutinizing the dried ink would make it come alive. </p><p>Father had left. Had risen up with all that talk of freedom, of unshackling the chains, and he’d just… left. He just left. Ran North, leaving his family behind, because <em>there was nothing to do. </em>He’d brought his people up from the pits of hell and left them to suffer.</p><p>“Why?” I blurted out. “Why’d he give up?”</p><p>He continued, “Rand’ar your father understood something that you do not yet. He saw that winning battles doesn’t mean winning wars. That violence only begets more violence. He saw that killing everything in your path doesn’t make you strong, it makes you a slave to your rage.” He took the paper from me, my fingers dragged along the edge, almost refusing to let go. “Sons growing up without fathers, continuing the cycle of violence and revenge.” He looked me in the eye, “You know something about that.”</p><p>“Does a leader not accomplish his goal? By any means necessary? I did that, I got our team the flag, Tommy and Mirvel made it back because of what I did.”</p><p>“Four children are dead, boy. These were some of the only killings in the Trial this year. The other recruits—your own friends—fear you. A frightening leader is an ineffective one.” He sat back down and clasped his hands together, “You want to be more like your father? Hmm? Learn to control your rage, to acquire the respect of your team. “</p><p>He leaned forward, “Haestus didn’t command men, he roused them, the rage within them, and tamed it. They didn't follow him out of duty or fear. When he spoke of freedom, they took it like scripture. When he asked them to die, they went willingly, as if death for the cause was worth more than life without it.”</p><p>“I don’t care that you killed them, Rand’ar. I care that you killed them out of stupidity. Out of rage. Like a child playing the knight, with no thought for reputation or legacy.”</p><p>“You said you knew him longer than I’d been alive, then tell me, why did he really go North? What was he really running from?” I asked.</p><p>“That’s not a conversation for today,” he asserted.</p><p>“You brought me here, showed me his letter. You can’t just—” </p><p>“I will,” he snapped. “You want to know more? Earn it. The Trial proved you can survive, prove to me you’re an effective leader. You’ll be getting real assignments in the coming months—out in the real world, with real consequences. You’ll work with Kalandyr, who’ll watch over you. Succeed, prove you are worthy of Haestus’s legacy, and you will learn more.” </p><p>I grumbled, his eyes shot up at me, glaring. I got up to leave the room. If he wasn’t going to give me answers, I’d have to find them myself. From Faux perhaps, or Hurbasa. I donned my boots at the door and buttoned my coat and made to open the door.</p><p>“Did you hear it, Rand'ar? Did you hear the blade?” Astaron started.</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>“How it whispered in your ear, like a devil. Creeping on you, inching up in your desperate moment, begging you to call for it. It hissed for you, to your opponent, like a loyal hound. But really, it is a snake. When the violence is over, it says ‘but I did not do it, it was all you.’ Defy the blade Rand’ar, don’t fall for its whisperings, and you may be a better man than your father. Remember this Rand’ar. When you face the blade again—don’t fall for its seductive lies. And it <em>always </em>lies.”</p><p> “That will be all,” he finished, back to scratching something on a paper with his quill.</p><p>I stepped out into the cold, staring into the distant mountains. Kael lay somewhere out there. What was that all about at the end, I wondered. Was he telling me to put the blade down, I didn’t understand. None of it made sense—Astaron’s ramblings, Father’s abandonment. Too many questions, and too few answers, it all made my head spin. But I was owed one answer at least—from Kalandyr, so I searched for him.  </p><p>I sauntered down the towering steps of the great tower, the vast courtyard loomed ahead of me. A group of students practiced against each other, running drills under Hurbasa’s watchful eye. His voice cut through the air, barking corrections.</p><p>Beyond them, servants hauled crates toward the kitchens, steam rising from the building’s bold chimneys. The smell of baking bread mixed with woodsmoke, wafted in the air. Near the stables, I could hear the clang of the blacksmith's hammer—someone getting a blade repaired, probably from the Trial.</p><p>The compound felt different after I had come back. Before it had felt like a prison, shackles holding me back, now it gave the feeling of a second home, busy and full of the bustling noise of people. Safe grounds to rest on before going back out again. </p><p>I found Kalandyr past the training grounds, by the livestock pens of the eastern edge of the training grounds. He was tending to a small flock of goats, tossing hay over the fence, his breath misting in the cold.</p><p>“You’re here for your answer,” he said, without looking up, as he tossed more hay.</p><p>“You said I’d get it if I survived,” I replied defensively.</p><p>“I did. You survived,” he brushed his hands off and turned to face me, “Go ahead, one question. Make it count.”</p><p>“What did the Abyss do to me?” I asked, grimly.</p><p>“I told you not to speak of <em>that</em>,” he snapped. He started slowly, “<em>It</em> revealed your true nature. One of your parents must’ve been gifted with the Sight. Did any of them have a twinkling purple in their eyes?”</p><p>“My father,” I replied immediately, “But what’s that got to do with me?”</p><p>“Over the next few months, you’ll get the same shift in your eyes. Your perceptions will be enhanced, both a curse and a blessing. Like I told you earlier, learn to block out the noise, and the curse will dissipate.”</p><p>“Block out the noise?” I stepped closer, “How? And what’s the Sight? What am I seeing?”</p><p>He looked at me for a long moment, perhaps wondering how much to say. “The Sight shows you what others miss. Patterns. Intentions. You’ll see movements almost before they even happen, as if you can react the instant they occur. But it also floods you with everything else. Every movement, every sound, every heartbeat.”</p><p>“That’s why the headaches.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s why the headaches,” he confirmed. “You receive everything at once with no filter. Most who inherit it learn to control it when they are young. You?” He shook his head, “<em>It</em> ripped it out of you, forced your Essence to flood you.”</p><p>“So how do I control it?”</p><p>“Practice. Focus. Time. And more practice.” He turned back to the goats. “<em>It </em>awakened it inside you, but it was always within you. Just like your father, and your father’s father.”</p><p>“Did you struggle with it too?”</p><p>Kalandyr paused for a moment, turning slowly away. “Your question was ‘What did the Abyss do to me?’ I already answered more than just that.”</p><p>He must have, he said he’d touched it too, <em>The Abyss</em>. Just thinking about it gave me trembles. The endless falling, the infinite dark, the lack of sensation. It was hell, in a way no man could imagine it without experiencing it for themselves.</p><p>“We’re going to be working together. Astaron wants me to keep an eye on you.” </p><p>I tensed, “To make sure I don’t lose control?”</p><p>“To make sure you survive what comes next—and that too. The Sight makes you dangerous, to yourself and others.”</p><p>“And what, you’re supposed to teach me?”</p><p>“I’m supposed to keep you alive long enough for you to become useful. Astaron’s invested a lot in you, you know? You’ll need to get stronger fast.” He started walking back toward the dining hall. “Get some rest. Tomorrow we start real training. Nothing like you’ve ever done before.”</p><p>He left me standing by the goat pens, with new questions, apprehensions. The cold wind cut through my coat, a reminder of what had been, of the coming winter. It would be nothing like the North.</p><p>I wondered what my family was up to, they’d probably given up on me by then, had a funeral perhaps. Went back to their normal lives—they had to keep living after all. Minarra and Daryen must’ve started school by then. Remi would be practicing for the Institute exams, and there I was, across the Belt, with the people we’d left behind. Closer to the ghost of my father than I’d ever been. </p><p>My entire life had been upturned, I’d abandoned all sense of normalcy. It seemed everything in the South was the opposite, even the people. </p><p>In the North, everyone kept their head down. Looked after themselves. Trusted no one. Perhaps it was safer that way—certainly easier. But here? Tommy and Mirvel had followed me off that cliff without hesitation. Even Rhen—desperate, brutal—had fought alongside Kadar like they were brothers. </p><p>These people had formed bonds that transcended blood. Formed bonds that meant something, even in a place like this—like it was the only thing that mattered. Maybe that’s what Father understood, that’s what made those people follow him, jeopardising their own lives for him. It’s what made men follow him through a rebellion that was fated to lose. Loyalty wasn’t just duty—it was more than that, and I wasn’t sure I understood it then. <em>Is this what friendships are supposed to be?</em> I wondered. It didn’t make sense. It must be a means to an end, I decided. </p><p>I looked back across the courtyard, the group had dissipated and another group had taken its place, a younger one. Perhaps another batch of children who’d one day take the Trial. </p><p>I peered beyond the gate, beyond the village below, out in the open world. A world that had a calling for me, I just needed to find my place in it.</p><p>A soft snow began to fall, had already started to blanket the withered stone ground. The mountains, despite their looming strength, would be covered too. In that moment, I looked up at the soft pillowy clouds and closed my eyes.</p><p>For the first time since I’d fallen in the dark, I let myself just feel. Not the overwhelming rush of sounds, not the stabbing pain in my head—just the gentle cold of snowflakes falling on my cheek. </p><p>When they’d taken me from Nothello, I’d been someone else. After the Trial, I’d become someone else. Not better, perhaps worse, but someone new. Someone forged by the pain, by the blood, by choices I couldn’t take back. </p><p>But it was a fresh start, and a fresh start meant new foundations.</p><p> I could forge myself anew, figure out what kind of man I wanted to be.</p><p><a id=\"_gmmd1rphaiz2\"></a></p><p><a id=\"_3kyjazgtghgw\"></a>END OF PART I</p><p><a id=\"_9fyddsim6dea\"></a>PART II</p>"

      "content": "<p>“Abba, why’d we have to leave the South?” I asked. I craned up to look at him as we sat on the edge of a wooden dock, his stern face shadowed by the sun above. </p><p>My fishing rod lay beside me, line tangled and long forgotten. I kicked my legs over the water instead, watching the ripples spread.</p><p>“The South is a rich land filled with beautiful souls,” he sighed, his line still in the water. “There’s rolling hills and dense forests as far as the eyes can see. And the people—families gather every evening, sharing meals and stories. No one eats alone.”</p><p>“Huuuuh?” I tilted my head to look at him. “Then why don’t we go back?”</p><p>“There’s also the bad people, they stay hidden in the corners and try to hurt families like ours,” his voice grew quiet. “Our family over there—they were taken by the bad people. Changed. We can’t go back, not ever.”</p><p>“But Abba, did you try to save them? Our family?”</p><p>“I—”</p><p>His line suddenly tugged, pulling my gaze towards the ripples in the water ahead.</p><p>“Look! Something’s tugging the line!” he exclaimed. He motioned me over and handed me the rod gently, resting his big burly hands on my shoulders. “Now remember, slowly reel it in just like I showed you before.”</p><p>NO—</p><p>He was just about to answer. Fuck.</p><p>But the boy I’d been was back to laughing, leaning over the water as the line went taut. The question had dissolved like mist.</p><p><em>Please</em>, I begged myself. Why was I so stupid? Why was it all so fuzzy…</p><p>The sword was firm in my hands. Sweat lined my arms in the summer heat. He thrust at my chest. <em>Easy</em>. I stepped to the side and swung the wooden sword toward his neck.</p><p>My eyes darted to his face—his eyes, they were … black, like there was nothing behind them. A shiver crawled down my spine and I quickly averted my gaze. Before I’d finished the swing, he’d recalled his sword and pressed mine away.</p><p>“Good, good,” he said. His voice sounded hollow, distant, but still familiar. “You’re getting better, Rand’ar. Heard you’ve been training Minarra?”</p><p>Something felt wrong about that. <em>You were already gone by then</em>, I thought. <em>You abandoned me too</em>.</p><p>I was taller then—almost reached his shoulder. The practice yard felt… different, the edges blurred together. He’d been gone for years by then. </p><p>“Why’d you give up on them, Father?” A hint of accusation in my voice. “On our people—our family?”</p><p>“Your uncle—Aldrich—sided with our oppressors. He said it was the only way to keep our people alive,” his voice echoed flatly. “I couldn’t bear to see that any more, how he’d been corrupted—” </p><p>“So you left them? Didn’t try to help him see reason?” I cut across. I stared back into his eyes, everything in me begged to look away. I was wrong before—his eyes weren’t completely black. Something swirled inside them, like shadows made of mist. Fear took over and my eyes darted down into the dirt.</p><p>“So you didn’t have to see the suffering?” I continued bitterly.</p><p>The sun had begun setting for the night, long shadows stretched across the courtyard.</p><p>“I didn’t want to kill him,” he growled, his voice obscure and unfamiliar. “We fought many times. I tried to explain it to him—with him at my side, we could’ve stormed the Citadel. But he doubted it, was firm that we’d lose and I was wrong.”</p><p>“Astaron begged for an attack on the Citadel. But we didn’t have the numbers. We needed your uncle’s support, and he’d already chosen his side.” His voice cracked. “Going to war would’ve meant one of us would’ve had to kill the other. I… couldn’t go through with that.”</p><p><em>Astaron already told me that</em>. Father was supposed to tell me more. Why hadn’t he explained when he was still alive? Now he was in the fucking grave, and he’d left me piss-all in the way of answers.</p><p>But the boy back then didn’t know the right questions to ask, couldn’t possibly know what Father was talking about. Before he could continue, darkness swallowed the yard, the last of sunlight vanished. The darkness swallowed us whole. When I opened my eyes again we were somewhere else.</p><p>I was sprawled on the ground. It was dark, not a single star in the sky, no sign of the moons either—just darkness. I pushed myself up and looked around. The place was unfamiliar and empty—like a painting barely started. I saw trees on the edges of my peripheral but I could never be sure, nothing to ground me to where I was.</p><p>I turned around and saw it—a dark figure, but not dark like shadow. Father, it had to be him, right? I stood up straight, as tall as the figure. </p><p>It had to be Father, the figure had the same broad shoulders, the same set of the jaw, but where his face should’ve been, there was only void. The figure stood reserved, the same darkness moved inside him, writhing and coiling like something sentient.</p><p>“Father?” My voice came out, deeper then, but hollow. I couldn’t see anything beyond him, everything was so dark, like all the light in the world had been taken away.</p><p>“You’re a coward,” I snarled. “Why’d you leave us? Why didn’t you explain things to me before you died?”</p><p>The figure stared blankly at me, seeing right through me. I looked behind me—was he looking at something else? There was nothing.</p><p>“Did you leave the South because you knew you'd failed? Or because you knew I’d have to be the one to finish it?” I pressed on. </p><p>Still nothing. The figure stood motionless.</p><p>“What kind of father leaves his son in the dark? You trained me all those years but you never explained why, you just told me to get stronger. I am stronger now!” I sobbed. I tried to grab him but my scarred hands passed right through. “Don’t you see, I’ve gotten so much stronger. We can fight together now!”</p><p>But he was gone, never coming back. <em>Why was it hitting me so hard now? It’d been almost a decade since he’d passed. Why did it still hurt so much?</em></p><p>“I’ve trained! W-with Astaron! I can help you. Just… come back.” I weeped quietly. A knot formed in my throat as I tried holding back the tears. “Please Abba, just say anything. Anything!”</p><p>When I looked back up, the figure had dissolved into the darkness, leaving a swirling trail of light behind. <em>Something’s wrong</em>, I told myself. I pressed on, following the hazy light through the dark, stumbling over objects or roots I couldn’t see. As I kept following the light, it got brighter, pulsing and sentient. I broke into a full sprint after it, scared I’d lose it and be stuck in the dark forever.</p><p>The light led to the same figure of Father, yet something was wrong, his body was morphed. His arms were twisted unnaturally, his neck bent at an awkward angle. The mouth—rather a line barely resembling a mouth—moved. Sound came out, but it wasn’t words. A low hum, barely audible, like the ringing of a scream in a dreary cave. The sound burrowed into my skull, the vibrations threatened to tear my head open.</p><p>My legs began to tremble—falter—and the ground gave way, disappearing entirely. I tried to scream—but no sound came out. I fell through nothing. Through a sea of ink that grabbed and consumed me, cold as a bar of steel. The only sound was the ringing of bells, chiming, tolling, clanging in the distance.  </p><p>I tried to flail, but my limbs wouldn’t budge, like they’d never existed, like I was nothing but part of the sea of void. My name scattered like ash, my essence diffused like a threadbare rope. <em>Rand’ar—what did that mean? Who—</em></p><p>“Up! Now!” Something hissed in my ears.</p><p>I gasped, my chest was heaving. Sweat drenched my shirt, cold against my skin. Hands gripped my shoulder, solid, real, shaking me hard enough to rattle my teeth. The world tilted around me—trees, firelight, the smell of smoke. Not the dark. Not the fall. I tried to speak but my throat was raw. </p><p>“Are you c—” Faux started, gaping into my eyes. “Never mind. Bandits. Move. Quiet!”</p><p>I wiped my face roughly. Tears? No,<em> sweat</em>, I told myself. I was sweating. <em>Why would I be crying?</em></p><p>I slipped off my coat, picked up the blade beside my bedroll, checked for my knives—one in my boot and one in my belt.</p><p>Faux motioned me to crawl over to the treeline. I sloshed through the mire, the mud seeped into my trousers. </p><p>Kalandyr was already positioned behind a log, still as stone, eyes tracking the bandits' approach. To my left, Kerra crouched low behind some shrubbery, blade on the ready, face hard and focused. Beside her, Mysha’s hand rested on her bow, calm despite the tension. Faux settled in next to me.</p><p>“How many?” I asked Faux. </p><p>“Five,” he whispered. I could barely make out two of them, my eyes still adjusting to the dark. One of the two held a torch and trudged toward our deserted camp.</p><p>“They were just ‘ere,” one of them said, a burly, ragged voice. “Don’t let ‘em get away, Drask’s gonna ‘ave our heads.”</p><p>“Look what we have here,” a third one whistled. <em>Shit</em>, he’d found our horses. He shoved his torch in their faces, ran his hands along their manes. “I say we let the fuckers go, take the horses ‘fore they come back for ‘em.”</p><p>One of the horses flared its nostrils, tried rearing up, but the rope snapped taut, jerking its head down. It stamped and pulled against the tree, whinnying sharp and high. The others started pulling too, ropes creaking.</p><p>“Those bastards,” Kerra growled, a fierce look in her eyes. “They’ve spooked the horses, it’ll take forever to calm them down.”</p><p>“We’ll get ‘em, don’t you worry,” Faux said. “Mysha, Kerra, take cover and watch for more of ‘em. When I give ya the signal, you start shootin’ like hell.”</p><p>Mysha nodded along quietly.</p><p>“Rand’ar, Kal,” he continued. “You both go down there and deal with the rest.”</p><p>“And you?” I asked.</p><p>“Gonna have a little chat with one of ‘em,” he grinned, like this was the most fun he’d had in weeks.</p><p>“I can fight too,” Kerra snarled. “Let me go down there with them.”</p><p>“I got no doubt that yer a fighter. But need ya up her with Mysha, so ya can pick ‘em off when they scatter. More useful than ‘nother blade down there,” Faux shrugged.</p><p>Her jaw tightened but she nodded, sheathing her sword. Faux slipped into the trees and we waited apprehensively. Down at the camp, the men plundered, stuffing down whatever morsel’s worth of goods they could find—mainly food. It must’ve been half a minute, but it felt like an eternity, before I heard a piercing whistle.</p><p>I leaped out of the bushes and sprinted down the hill, aiming for the one closest to me—the burly one. He was bent down, too busy rummaging through our gear. </p><p>“Look out—” the one by the horses bellowed, an arrow whizzed through the dark and cut his shrieking short.</p><p>The other two brandished their swords and waved them desperately toward me and Kalandyr. </p><p>“These don’t look like toilers,” one of them muttered.</p><p>“Sure as hell don’t,” The other shivered, backing up and shoving his sword desperately out toward me. “Don’t come any closer! We’ve got more of us down the road.”</p><p>I didn’t slow. Closed the distance in three quick strides. He swung high for my neck. I ducked under, watched as the blade made its way across, and thrust my blade into his throat.</p><p>His eyes went wide. Blood spewed out of his mouth, staining the steel. Beside me Kalandyr plunged his sword deep into the other bandit’s chest, dropping him to his knees.</p><p>I heard a guttural scream pierce the night—somewhere in the trees. Then another sound cut through. Sharper. Terror.</p><p>I spun toward the camp. The last bandit had broken from his cover and made a run for his horse. Kerra was already moving—fast, crashing down the hill. Her sword was drawn up to her shoulders and her eyes had a ferocious look in them. </p><p>The poor bastard didn’t even see her coming. She yelled something incoherent and drove her sword between his shoulders. His blood sprayed out and he tumbled into the mud. </p><p>“I had it handled,” Kalandyr retorted.</p><p>“He would’ve ran—,” Kerra doubled over, panting. “Would’ve called for backup.”</p><p>“Calm yourselves.” Faux pulled out of the bushes, Mysha followed behind. He dragged along a corpse—no, it was still alive. The last of the bandits, a boy—barely older than I was when I did the Trial. He was gagged, the cloth ripped into his mouth as he mumbled incoherently. </p><p>Faux brought his hand down to loosen the cloth, the boy flinched and his eyes went wide with terror. Faux bent down to meet the boy’s horrified eyes. </p><p>“This one’s gonna tell us all about this Drask and his little operation. Ain’t that right, boy?” Faux smirked.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The first lights of day had dawned onto the forest we’d set up in. The boy, Osric, was strung to a withering tree, far from the main road. Far enough his screams could not be heard. He tried wiggling around, but the rope only bit deeper into his skin, leaving it raw. The gag bit into his jaw, saliva drooled out of the sides of his mouth as Faux edged closer with a serrated knife, a vicious grin plastered on his face.</p><p>“So who’s this Drask one of yer boys mentioned?” He asked, dragging the knife along Osric’s bare throat.</p><p><em>You’re not actually going to hurt him right?</em> Mysha had asked earlier. <em>He’s only a boy.</em></p><p><em>‘Course not, just need answers outta him</em>, Faux answered reassuringly.</p><p>What sympathy did he deserve? Sympathy I hadn’t gotten when I’d been kidnapped from home.</p><p>I loosened the gag from Osric’s mouth. He coughed convulsively, trying to regain control of his rapid breathing. </p><p>“I don’t know, me swears it—we was just robbing, that’s all!” He tried to put on a brave smile, but it came out as an uneasy grin. “Drask? Me’s never heard of him!”</p><p>His voice shook and his eyes glanced nervously around the group, Kerra bared her teeth at him. Kalandyr looked bored, sharpening his blade. Mysha’d climbed a tall branch and kept watch for any other bandits.</p><p>Faux’s grin only widened, he pushed the blade harder against Osric’s throat, still not cutting like he’d promised. “Boy, I can tell when yer lyin’. Try again, who’s this Drask?”</p><p>“H-h-he’s just some lord ‘round here!” Osric blurted out. His eyes darted between the blade and Faux’s odd grin. “He pays us to patrol the roads, keep watch for any stragglers and bring ‘em back. That’s all me knows, swear it!”</p><p>Faux’s grin faltered—like he’d been expecting more of a fight from the boy. “Why would he be payin’ ya? Ain’t yer group a nuisance to him too?”</p><p>“We’s supposed to let merchants and official lookin’ folk pass through. Please! Put the knife down!” He begged, tears streaming down his face.</p><p>“Quiet, boy!” Kerra snapped, “Or I’ll start taking fingers.”</p><p>I watched Osric tremble, tears trickling down his cheeks. <em>Just a kid—no older than I was at the Trial,</em> I thought. But he’d chosen his side—hunting runaways for coin. I had no sympathy for the bastard.</p><p>“Faux,” I suddenly said. “Why don’t we… reconvene, discuss over there,” I nodded my head down toward a clearing. </p><p>He grunted and I stuffed the gag back in Osric’s mouth. He tried to mumble or beg something, but I couldn’t quite catch it, it just came out as a muffled groan. I fastened the bindings, making sure he couldn’t budge, and walked over to Faux and Kerra.</p><p>“Why’re we asking him anything? We killed the bandits already, so let's keep moving.” I said.</p><p> “Because, Rand’ar,” he frowned. “We don’t want more of ‘em followin’ after us into Greyport.”</p><p>He continued, “Besides, this Drask—he’s got coin, property—probably a manor, maybe some workers locked up. We take him out, we remove a threat <em>and</em> maybe find folks who'll owe us. Never hurts to have grateful people in unfamiliar territory.\"</p><p>“We’ve got a mission. Infiltrate Greyport and report to Astaron. This…” I waved my hands around, at Osric, at everything, “complicates things. Could risk the mission. What if this Drask’s got Sargaryn connections and they find out, then we’re fucked.”</p><p>“Drask’s a backwater lord,” Faux said. “No one’s gonna miss him.”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” Kalandyr cut in. “If we start picking fights with every <em>backwater</em> lord between here and the coast, we’ll be dead before we ever give the signal to Astaron.”</p><p>Mysha dropped down from the branch, folding her arms.  “So what, we leave these people enslaved, because it's <em>inconvenient</em>?”</p><p>“Because it’s a risk,” I said. “It's about not jeopardizing the mission for—\"</p><p>“For what?” Mysha cut across. “Isn’t this what we do all this for? For people like us?”</p><p>“Don’t act like a Northerner,” Kerra snapped at me. “Comfortable in their warm homes, counting their coins. Pretending suffering doesn’t exist because they don’t see it.”</p><p><em>How close you are, Kerra</em>. The irony burned within me. Kalandyr’s eyes flickered to me—a knowing glance. He and Faux knew the truth.</p><p>“That’s how <em>they</em> act, Rand’ar,” Mysha said softly. “Pragmatic and practical. They’d let someone else suffer as long as the mission stayed clean.”</p><p>“It’s decided then,” Faux said, putting the blade back in his belt. “We’re goin’ to Drask’s. A little detour never hurt anybody.”</p><p>I grunted in response. A detour always hurts somebody, especially when we’d be going looking for trouble. Trouble Astaron specifically told us to avoid. <em>What did saving a few broken slaves matter? They’d just roam around miserably until they found a new master, only we wouldn’t be around to save them again, </em>I thought.</p><p>If we failed the mission, Astaron would have no use for me. He’d put me back in those deplorable scouting missions—the same mind-numbing patrols he’d assigned me after the Trial. Two years of watching empty roads while the wind bit my skin. I wasn’t ready to go back to that, a tread through the Belt back home was more favorable.</p><p>All that time Astaron dangled empty answers about Father in front of me. Said I still hadn’t shown I was in control, shown I was ready to be a leader. How was I meant to show that while watching desolate roads in the mountains. <em>Even now, he’s put me as the youngest one here, so that I can’t lead anyone</em>, I thought bitterly. </p><p>All those years and I still hadn’t learnt why Father ever started the rebellion. What made him sacrifice everything for these people. Astaron must’ve known more, but he held back. <em>He’s just stringing me along, using me for my eyes</em>, or so I thought.</p><p>“Are we just going along with this,” I hissed in Kalandyr’s ear after the others dispersed. “This is bound to fuck the mission over.”</p><p>“What choice do we have?” Kalandyr sighed. “We can’t go on without them. Focus on what you can control, we train while we wait.”</p><p>“Practice the Sight. Train. Practice. That’s all it is with you. What good is it if we don’t use that training in the field,” I shot back.</p><p>“What do you think’s going to happen in Greyport—we’re going to fight? No, we're here to infiltrate. ” He met my eyes. “You still can’t control your rage, I saw how you didn’t hesitate once—shoved your blade straight through that man’s throat.”</p><p>“I remember you doing the same,” I muttered back.</p><p>He just stared back at me, something flickered behind those hardened purple eyes. </p><p>“Pick up your blade, show me that you have control,” he said, walking toward a clearing in the trees.</p><p>I scoffed at him. Astaron told me I had to train with Kalandyr. Said if I didn’t I’d be off the missions.</p><p>On the edge of the clearing, Mysha and Kerra practiced with their longbows, seeing who could hit a tree in the distance. Kerra shot wide, swearing as her arrow thudded into the dirt.</p><p>“You’re pulling too hard,” Mysha said calmly. “Let the bow do the work.” Her shot struck dead center.</p><p>Kerra scowled, “Easy for you to say, show-off.”</p><p>“Jealous,” Mysha teased back.  </p><p>Faux was back to taunting Osric, leering over the bound boy. </p><p>I pulled out my sword and my knife. We’d sparred with steels before—Kalandyr trusted me not to kill him, and I trusted the same. I held my sword arm out in front of me, and my knife hand pulled close to my face, ready for anything that got through.</p><p>Kalandyr got into his own stance, nothing so simple like our first duel in The Gauntlet. Two blades crossed in front of him, the steels gleamed against each other.</p><p>I closed the distance first. <em>Never fight angry</em>, Father’s words echoed in my head. To hell with that, anger was the only thing that’d kept me going all those years. </p><p>I thrust my sword at his crossed blades, the steel scraped against his, he shoved it to the side. His swords hissed as they came at me in a blur—left, right, overhead. My eyes tracked the flurry of attacks, but my arms couldn’t keep up. </p><p>His left sword broke past my guard, knocking my sword aside, I pushed down—hard—with my knife, creating distance as I pivoted away, breathing hard.</p><p>“You’re watching my swords, not me.” Kalandyr said, he didn’t look the least bit tired. “Your opponents’ eyes tell you everything about what they’ll do. Learn to read that, and you won't ever need the Sight.”</p><p><em>Always spouting the same shit</em>, I thought. I desperately wanted to wipe that impassive look off his face—to see the real rage underneath that mask of stone. </p><p><em>Never fight tired, </em>the words resounded in my ears<em>.</em> Tired from the journey, the nightmares, the compounding questions, tired from all of it. I rushed toward him, swinging rapidly like a fly stuck behind a window. He parried each strike with perfection, as if he saw the strikes coming before I’d thought them through. </p><p>My eyes flickered to his, there was nothing. His moves weren’t magically imprinted in the purple irises. Just cold focus stared back. </p><p>The distraction cost me. Kalandyr’s blade pushed against mine and his other slipped past my guard. In one fluid motion, he pressed my sword arm wide and pressed his other blade against my chest—right over my heart—and swept my legs out from under me.</p><p>I hit the ground hard. Dead. Again.</p><p>He sneered at me, baring his teeth, then withdrew his blade and turned  away. </p><p>“You see why we keep training now?” he called back.</p><p>I glared daggers at his back in response, rubbing my leg where I'd fallen.</p><p>“That boy's a machine. You ask me, I’d say you did pretty good,” Kerra said, holding out a hand.</p><p>A machine no doubt, but that’s the level of mastery I needed if I wanted to gain Astaron’s trust in these missions—to gain some independence. The mastery I needed if I was to get my revenge on that wretched woman who’d tortured me. Just thinking about it made me seethe. </p><p>I grabbed Kerra’s outstretched hand and pulled myself up from the dirt. </p><p>“Thanks,” I muttered, my jaw still tight with frustration.</p><p>“You really think this detour’s gonna fuck everything up?” Kerra asked.</p><p>“Probably—doesn’t matter now,” I shrugged. “Faux already made the call.”</p><p>“And you’re just going along with it?” she narrowed her eyes, hands on her hips.</p><p>“What do you want me to say? You guys pushed for it,” I said.</p><p>“I just don’t want you messing it up. I can see you’re plotting something behind those purple eyes of yours.”</p><p>“You’re not planning on leaving us. Are you, Rand’ar?” Mysha smiled, adjusting the string of her bow as she approached.</p><p>“Of course not,” I said quickly. <em>Leave and go where?</em> I still had questions that needed answers, strength that required building. I was stuck with this crew. Competent they were no doubt, but they lacked ambition, a drive for something beyond the mission they’d been assigned. Only Kalandyr matched me in that. I may not have been able to read his moves by staring into his eyes, but I could see he was working towards something. </p><p>Kerra picked up my fallen knife from the ground, turned it over a few times before handing it to me, “Where’d you learn to fight like that? I’ve seen you at The Gauntlet—you came in knowing how to use that blade.”</p><p>“My father,” I said. The words mulled over in my head. I’d forgotten about that torment of a dream I’d had the night before. </p><p>“Marshin father teaching his son to fight?” her eyebrow raised. “Must’ve been expecting trouble.”</p><p>“He was always expecting trouble after the Withdrawal,” I looked away. “Didn’t help him in the end.”</p><p>“We’ve all lost people,” Mysha said quietly. “That’s why we keep fighting on—so others don’t have to.”</p><p>I didn’t answer. Wasn't sure I agreed. I fought purely for myself. <em>Why should I fight for someone else? What does that get me? Pain and despair.</em> But pain I could bear, pain that pushed me towards what I wanted.</p><p>Kerra shifted, uncomfortable with the moment's weight. \"Well, standing around won't get us to Drask's. Faux looks about done with that boy.\"</p><p>We walked through the trees to where Osric was strung up. Sweat trickled down his face, his eyes darted around nervously between all of us. His trousers were wet, and it hadn’t rained. The kid must’ve pissed himself with fear.</p><p>“Boy’s gonna show us to Drask’s,” Faux started. He held up Osric’s head to meet his own eyes. “Aren’t you boy?”</p><p>“Y-yes! Yes! Me’s showin’ you the way to Lord Drask,” he put on a nervous smile, refusing to meet anyone’s eyes.</p><p>Faux grinned and cut him loose. Osric stumbled, nearly fell before pointing a shaky hand toward the road.</p><p>“Days walk normally, but you’s got horses. Could be there by sundown.” He rubbed his raw wrists, then choked out, “Lord Drask’s manor sits on a hill—couldn’t miss it.”</p><p>I sheathed my blade, put my knife back in its scabbard. Kerra checked her own blade, Mysha shouldered her longbow. Kalandyr’s expression remained unreadable as always.</p><p>A few hours to Drask’s. A few hours before we’d see what freedom truly cost. </p>"

      "content": "<p>Our horses trotted along the dirt road, the sound of hooves clattering against the ground, splashing mud onto my trousers. The last hours of sunlight peered down on us through the clouded sky as we travelled through the grassy wetlands. Tall grass spouted out from the shallow pools of water on either side of the road. Nothing moved but the wind swaying the grass. No villages, no farms—just endless stretches of marsh swallowing the horizon.</p><p>The marshes had a deep reddish colour to them, algae blooming in the brackish water. It looked like diluted blood. The standing water stood eerily among the swaying grass. The air smelled of rot and iron, insects hummed in clouds above the marsh. No signs of people, as if the land itself had been abandoned. I couldn’t blame the people who’d left, it was a wasteland of bog and mud.</p><p>Faux’s horse trotted at the head of our group, his back proud and valiant. Kalandyr rode beside Faux. They were deep in an argument, no doubt about how this was a waste of time and we should be heading for the coast instead.  Behind them, Kerra and Mysha rode side by side, leaning close and whispering something that made them both laugh.</p><p>I brought up the rear. Osric sat behind me on my horse, bound hands gripping the saddle to keep from falling.</p><p>“Never been this far east before?” Osric asked. His voice was shaky, like he was trying too hard to be friendly.</p><p>I didn’t answer.</p><p>\"Me’s grown up 'round here, y'know. My ma’s used to—well, she ain't ‘round no more, but she used to say the marshes got spirits in 'em. Souls of folk who drowned, trapped in the marshes forever. Said that’s why them marshes are red.\" He laughed nervously. \"Load of shit, probably. But still, makes ya think, don't it?\"</p><p>He got nothing but silence. </p><p>“Yous ever seen a spirit before? Me’s ain’t, but me cousin—well—he said he did once, out by the—\"</p><p>“Osric,” I cut him off flatly. “Shut up.”</p><p>He went quiet for maybe thirty seconds.</p><p>“It's just, me gets nervous when it's quiet, y'know? Me thinks too much about—”</p><p>“Osric.”</p><p>“Right. Sorry. Shuttin' up now.”</p><p>He lasted another minute before starting up again. Something about how his brother swore up and down about how he’d seen riders clad in white in the waters at night.</p><p>“Land’s cursed by the Dark, me swears it! Only the Light keeps it alive.”</p><p>“If you’re going to keep talking, talk about Drask. His defenses, his guard, his movements. Whatever you know.”</p><p>Mysha loosened up on the reins, slowing her horse down to let us catch up to her.</p><p>“Aye. Lord Drask. He’s a fat little man, always smokin’ a pipe. Me family was never toilers—”</p><p>Mysha glared at him, tightening her reins. </p><p>Osric caught himself, stammering, “Err—never, uh… workers. Slaves. Whatever you lot calls ‘em. Me family was never… <em>that</em>.”</p><p>“Get to the point,” I snapped at him.</p><p>“Right, err—Drask. He’s got himself a guard of uh… slaves, all grew up thinkin’ he’s their dad or whatever. The guards always pickin’ fights with us freebooters, thinkin’ they better than us cause they devoted to the Light.”</p><p>“I don’t care about your problems with them, how many are there?” I asked.</p><p>“Me’s gettin’ to it, geez. Reckon there’s at least a dozen spread throughout the village, and at least five he keeps close to him.”</p><p>“Why would they think Drask’s their father?” Mysha asked.</p><p>“Don’t know, but they’s always callin’ him ‘Lord Father.’ Now that you mentions it, it always gaves me the creeps.” Osric recoiled at the thought.</p><p>“And his manor?” I pressed on.</p><p>“Me’s never been inside, bein’ a freebooter an’ all. From what the other guys say, he’s got hoards of gold.” He whistled, like the thought of it alone could buy him a new life.</p><p>“Are you fucking dense?” I snarled at him. “I don’t care for his money. I want to know how protected it is.”</p><p>“Then what do you lot cares for?” Osric said, his voice pitched. “Ain’t that what you’s here to do, rob Lord Drask.”</p><p>“We’re not scum like you,” Kerra shouted back. “We’re here for the people you and your lot hunt down for coin.”</p><p>“Right.” Osric said defeatedly.</p><p>“How come we ain’t seen anyone ‘round here, land looks proper for farmin’ the salt,” Faux called back.</p><p>Osric jumped at the opportunity to continue his babbling. “After the Withdrawal, slavers fled for North, leavin’ the workin’ folk to fend for themselves. For a while theys tried to farm the marshes, sell the salts to the merchants in Greyport. But then the floods started comin’ in—worse every year. Drowned half the fields, ruined the harvest. Workin’ folk couldn’t pay theys debts, and merchants stopped comin’. Lord Drask bought up what was left for nothin’. Now he owns all the land, all the salt pans, and all the folk workin’ em.”</p><p>“Then why does Drask pay you trash?” Kerra accosted.</p><p>“Me’s only heard this from me brothers. But apparently, Lord Drask gets paid by the nobles an’ merchants in Greyport to keep the free workers from runnin’ off. He puts that duty on us,” he boasted pridefully. “He pays our crew to make sure none ‘o the stragglers run off. We brings ‘em back, and Drask hopes he gets a bigger estate.”</p><p>He recited the answer like someone’d drilled it into him, perhaps a brother or one of the other bandits.</p><p>No one responded. The only sound being the hooves of our horses trudging through the mud and Osric’s nervous breathing behind me.</p><p>Our path winded through the red marshes, with no sign of another being, human nor animal, anywhere in sight.</p><p>Then Faux came to a sudden stop, my horse almost bumping into Kerra’s. </p><p>“What’s the hold up?” Mysha called out.</p><p>Then I saw them.</p><p>Bodies. Naked and hanging from wooden poles driven into the dirt along the sides of the roads. The bodies were twisted around the poles, their limbs jutting out. </p><p>Corpses. They’d been dead a long time. The gray skin peeled as flies buzzed around, beetles feasting on the dried open wounds. The corpses' mouths laid open, their teeth contorted in unnatural ways, like their faces had been hammered into the poles. </p><p>“Oh Hand of the Light, protect us.” Faux muttered. He pressed the palms of his hands flat against his chest, fingers splayed. A warding gesture, as if the prayer alone could keep the Dark at bay. </p><p>“Boy, what the hell’s goin’ on here,” Faux’s voice quivered. I’d never heard him this shaken before.</p><p>Osric muttered something incomprehensible.</p><p>“Speak up, boy!” Faux’s voice was rough, quaking with anger.</p><p>“The slaves that get caught runnin’ away, Drask beats ‘em bloody and leaves ‘em to rot out here. Lord Drask’s got to keep order somehow. Just how it is,” Osric murmured.</p><p>Kerra jumped off her horse, her eyes were seething with rage. She pulled out her knife out of its scabbard and walked toward us.</p><p>Osric writhed around behind me, trying to make a run for it. He slipped off the back of the horse and fell head-first into the mud. </p><p>“Wait, wait! We still need—” I jumped off my horse and moved towards Kerra.</p><p>Without hesitation, she drove her knife across Osric’s neck and cut the boy's throat open. His blood spurted onto the road, pooling into the mud, creating a pile of reddish brown. </p><p>Osric convulsed on the ground, gurgling on his own blood. His mouth moved, tried to speak, to beg—but only wet choking sounds came out. Then his movements ceased.</p><p>Mysha stared in disbelief—at Kerra. She couldn’t bring herself to look at the bloody ruins of Osric.</p><p>“Great,” Kalandyr clapped his hands together, only one still mounted on his horse. “That was our only source of information.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Faux breathed. He looked at the body, then Kerra, before his eyes darted away.</p><p>“What the hell was that for?” I yelled. “He was a lowlife, but we could’ve used him still. Now he’s a fucking corpse in our way.”</p><p>Kerra dragged the corpse off the road and tossed it into the shallow waters. She waded through the reeds, dragging Osric deeper into the marsh. The tall grass bent around him as she shoved his body under the murky water. It sank slowly, the pink algae creeping over his pale skin. </p><p>“What’s done is done, he got what he deserved.” She wiped her blade clean and stood there a moment, glancing one last time at where the body sunk, then mounted back on her horse.</p><p>It all happened so fast. Kerra just… butchered him, right there in the middle of the road. I’d seen violence before—killed men myself. But that felt different. I suppose it wasn’t, I’d killed Zach the same way in the Trial. And unlike Osric, Zach had been innocent. </p><p>The speed—efficiency with which Kerra did all of it, killing him and hiding Osric’s corpse, sent shivers down me. <em>Could she be trusted?</em> I wondered.</p><p>I slipped my foot into the stirrup and swung my body up and over the saddle. <em>Now we’re going in blind, no map, no intel on the guards’ position or routines</em>. We’d have to improvise, figure it all out ourselves.</p><p>As the sunlight dimmed and we trudged through the lines of corpses strung along the roads—each one more rotten than the last—the road climbed up a hill and we spotted a manor in the distance, Drask’s.</p><p>The manor jutted out at the hill’s peak, stone walls rising like a fortress. Below it, halfway down the hill, long barracks stretched in rows, crude stone buildings that were dilapidated and decaying.</p><p>“Faux, let’s plan before we move forward.” Kalandyr pulled on the reins bringing his horse to a stop.</p><p>We got off our horses and huddled between two dead trees that jutted out like skeletons. Mysha hung back, still silent, her eyes glossy and distant.</p><p>“Osric said there were a dozen guards around the village and five on Drask at all times,” I said, taking a bite of dried meat, wondering if it’d be my last meal. </p><p>“Assuming they’re trained, we can’t take on all of them at once,” Kalandyr said.</p><p>“We hit ‘em at night, guards won’t see us comin’. And with you two’s… sight, we can take ‘em before they raise the alarm,” Faux said.</p><p>Kalandyr shook his head, “Too risky, they’ll see five miscreants going around the village before we kill two. We don’t know the layout, patrol routes, nothing.” He glared at Kerra, who scowled back.</p><p>“One mistake and we’re fighting the whole garrison,” he continued.</p><p>“I have a plan,” I said. “This is a good one.”</p><p>We waded through the freezing water, crouched beneath the tall grasses. The water reached up to my knees, cold enough to numb them. It was dark. Even with the Sight, I could barely make out the manor in the distance. The insects clicked incessantly in the shadows. </p><p>“Can’t see anything,” Mysha hissed behind me.</p><p>“Quiet,” I whispered back, grabbing her arm, and leading her through the standing water. </p><p>We reached the base of the hill and crouched behind the tall grass that danced in the soft wind. The back of the hill was a lot steeper and laden with boulders. Enough so that no barracks were constructed. An open climb up toward the manor, but a swift and deadly fall if we slipped down the jagged rocks.</p><p>The manor was glowing with soft lighting, the windows casting long flickering shadows on the rocks, imposing even from the bottom where we stood. </p><p>“We’re climbing that?” Mysha exclaimed.</p><p>“I don’t see how we have a choice.” I studied the path up the pointed rocks, eyeing for handholds. “Can you see well enough from here?” </p><p>“I’ll manage.” She tested her grip on a nearby rock. “Just don’t climb too fast.”</p><p>I nodded and pointed toward a ledge halfway up, “We can rest there if we need to. Don’t want to rush and slip.”</p><p>I grabbed a pointed edge and pulled myself up, nestling my fingers deep between the rocks, squeezing for dear life. Mysha climbed faster than me, taking sporadic nervous glances downward. My soaked trousers dripped with water, making small splashes in the distant rocks below. </p><p>I pulled up with my left, then my right arm, careful to hug the rocks as I pulled myself up. My hands were damp, gripping the edges tightly, fingers threatening to slip. The ledges came and went, neither of us wanted to stop and we ascended faster than I’d expected. By the time we hauled ourselves over the top, my arms were shaking, but we’d made it. </p><p>I leaned against the stone wall, catching my breath, spreading out my fingers to get the blood flowing again.</p><p>We started to edge around the perimeter, searching for a way to get into the second floor, ducking under windows and steering clear of the edge.</p><p>We found a narrow open window on the second floor, barely wide enough to slip in, its shutters hung loosely on its hinges. There was a barrel nearby, just tall enough to stand on top of and sneak in through the window.</p><p>I crouched beneath the window and pressed my back against the cold stone. Mysha settled beside me, she’d left her bow behind with the horses and opted for her sword instead, which lay in her lap.</p><p>Then we waited.</p><p>The silence stretched on for a while, the distant sounds of pots and pans clacking and the voices of slaves working inside the house. I could hear distant shouts down the hill—guards perhaps.</p><p>Mysha shifted on the ground. “Back on the road,” she said quietly. “When Kerra killed that boy. You tried to stop her.”</p><p>I didn’t answer immediately.</p><p>“Would you have?” she pressed on. “If you’d reached her in time?”</p><p>I sighed and looked off into the distant swamp, or whatever I could see of it, unable to meet her gaze.</p><p>“I would, he still had his uses,” I said bluntly.</p><p>“Is that the only reason why? Because he was useful?” she asked softly.</p><p>I didn’t answer.</p><p>“Before Astaron freed us—me and Kerra I mean,” she started. “We were slaves for a man not so different from Drask. I used to work the house, dusting, laundry and whatnot. Kerra used to work the rice fields, her skin used to peel off her back because of the thick heat and I would patch her up. At some point, me and Kerra became close, or as close as people could be in that place. She would tell me she was riling the other workers up, trying to get them to stand up. But the others were scared, scared of leaving the comfort of familiarity behind.”</p><p>She sighed, looking up into the sky. The twin moons were locked in their eternal dance, pulling at each other like lovers. “The slaver, Dane, used to tell us we were lucky, that there was nothing beyond the chains for people like us. That we’d just starve and die. He made us believe we needed him.”</p><p>“And… I did—I believed him.” A single tear rolled down her cheek. “When Astaron’s people came, Kerra wanted blood, she’d taken a sickle and went on a killing spree, she couldn’t tell the difference between slave and slaver. It took years for me to show her that the problem was the Sargaryns and the North. Not our own people.”</p><p>Her voice wavered, “Then when I saw Kerra murder that boy, I thought her old self had come back, that—” She stopped, wiping at her eyes. The tears shone in the moonlight.</p><p>I didn’t know what to say, and even if I did, would I have said it? My hand reached for her before I’d thought about it. To comfort her, like I would’ve Daryen or Minarra when they came to me. To fix whatever was wrong. </p><p>But my hand faltered and I pulled back.</p><p>“Sorry I—” A quiet three-fold whistle pierced the chill air. Kerra’s signal.</p><p>Mysha wiped her face and nose. I dragged the hulking barrel right up to the stone wall, helped Mysha up on top, her eyes still red. She grabbed onto the ledge and peeked through the window.</p><p>“It’s clear,” she whispered, before climbing through.</p><p>I took one last look at the marshes below as I pulled myself up before slipping into the horrors inside.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The room was dark and cramped, littered with brooms, dustpans and ragged washcloths. I stood silently behind Mysha, ready to jump back out at the first sign of trouble. She peered through a small crack in the door, the light from the hallway slipping through.</p><p>She gasped suddenly and pulled away from the door.</p><p>“What is it?” I hissed. She just shook her head, covering her mouth.</p><p>I skirted around her and glanced through the angled door. A deep knot formed and twisted around in my stomach. Half a dozen girls, their arms shackled to the walls as they bent forward awkwardly with their hair covering their faces. If I hadn’t known any better, I’d say they were marked by The Abyss itself.</p><p><em>How could anyone—</em></p><p>“Merchants from Greyport you say?” A deep voice bellowed out from down below, cutting through my thoughts. Loud and eager, “Welcome, welcome! It’s rare we receive such distinguished guests in such dark times.”</p><p>Then the clattering of boots. The cover must’ve been working.</p><p>“Err, yes. We’ve heard you’ve got the best salt in the area, only the finest for the noblemen up North. Rest of the area seems pretty dead.” Faux worked his hardest to cover his thick Southern accent with the rhotic one of a sailor.</p><p>Mysha was crouched down against a wall in the dark closet, her eyes downcast and remote.</p><p>“Mysha, we have to keep moving.” I grabbed her hands. “We don’t have long but the cover’s working for now. We can still save these people.”</p><p>She stayed silent but got up, her face a mask of agony. I craned my neck out of the doorway, checked both sides—clear of guards. I pulled her  through the doorway behind me.</p><p>We crouched down and slipped past the hollowed girls, they stayed still and silent—save for their shallow breathing, as if we were never there. Mysha’s hand shot out toward one of the chains. I grabbed her wrist.</p><p>“We need the key,” I whispered. “We’ll come back for them.”</p><p>Her jaw tightened but she nodded, pulling her hand back and following after me. </p><p>There was a set of stairs leading down towards the room Drask was entertaining his new guests.</p><p>“Amara, brew our pleasant guests some tea, and do it fast.” Drask barked from below.</p><p>“Oh, you don’t have to trouble yourself—” Faux started.</p><p>“Nonesense! How could I not, you are my honoured guests.”</p><p>“Let’s get to business then,” Kalandyr cut through, forthright as always. “What’s your current monthly output? We need reliable supply—the noblemen don’t tolerate delays—”</p><p>Faux and Kalandyr had them distracted, we had our cue to stick to the plan.</p><p>We creeped down the hallway and I peered through the first room that was lit. Children lay on the floor, thin rags covering their little bodies. An old woman sat next to a laying boy, squeezing his head. She rocked back and forth, humming an old lullaby.</p><p>I stepped into the doorway, slowly, my hands visible and away from my sword. Mysha followed behind me. “By the Hand of the Light, we mean no harm to you. We’ve come to free you.”</p><p>“What’s you croakin’ about, boy,” the woman said, turning to look toward us. She had a shawl covering her ancient matted hair, the room reeked of sickness and herbs. One eye was pale and glassy while the other studied me suspiciously.</p><p>Beyond her, other slaves stirred—two women tending to the children in the corner. Their eyes shook nervously, glancing at the old woman, waiting. She was the one they looked to.</p><p>Mysha kneeled down in front of the old woman and matched her tense gaze, “We’ve come to free you from servitude.”</p><p>A wry cackle spewed out of her mouth as she continued rocking back and forth. “Only the Lightbearer himself can free us,” she snorted. “And he ain’t comin’ for a thousand years.”</p><p>“Forget about that, we can help you leave now. Gather the servants up, we’ll take care of Drask and his guards,” I said, still half-peering at the doorway in case a guard came up the stairs.</p><p>“Leave? Why?” She continued her senseless chortle. My blood began to boil, in the hallway women were chained up and there she was laughing as if we’d told her the sky was falling. “We got a roof o’er our heads here, food and clothes. We got a real home. Look at these poor ones, they’d be the first to starve out there.”</p><p>“So go, run back to where you came from, we ain’t needin’ your help,” she continued, putting a damp towel on the boy's head. </p><p>“You is only gonna bring down trouble on us,” a shrill voice said—one of the other slave women. </p><p>“You’re not living here, just coasting along,” I said. It was pointless. They were born in servitude, and they were prepared to die in it. Only the young ones caught my pity—they deserved a chance to live for themselves. The rest of them were weak, couldn’t fight for themselves, couldn’t even see for themselves. <em>Why should I bleed for them?</em></p><p>“There are places out there,” Mysha said, her voice steady despite the tremors in her hands. “Communities of Marshin, people just like you. They can take you in, help you start over.”</p><p>“What about the guard? Can they be turned?” I pressed.</p><p>“Bah,” she said. “Those fools are devoted to him. Grew up callin’ him Father, thinkin’ he saved ‘em from the gutter. He feeds ‘em well, clothes ‘em, gives ‘em weapons, makes ‘em feel special. They’d die for him ‘fore you’d get a word out.”</p><p> “Fool, they ain’t lettin’ us out,” the other slave spat out.</p><p>“—best salt in the area, can promise you that. Stay for dinner, try it yourself. Any nobleman’ll taste the quality of it,” Drask bragged from below.</p><p>“Impressive operation you’ve got out here. How do you maintain the quality with the… labor shortages?” Kalandyr asked. His words calm and pragmatic—befitting that of a true Northerner.</p><p>“Don’t you worry about the quality, it’ll never go down, by the Light. Come, come! Let me show you the operation.” </p><p>The barracks. Where Kerra was supposed to be freeing the field workers, taking down the guard one by one. I could only hope her part was going better than ours.</p><p>“How about dinner first?” Faux cut in quickly. “We’ve had a long journey to get here, and I’d hate to tour with my stomach grumbling” </p><p>“Hah! Of course! Only the most delicious meals for my guests.” Drask roared. “And after dinner, you’ll want to rest, I’m sure. I can have any of the house girls attend to your…needs, anything you want. My guests deserve the finest courtesy.”</p><p>A pause. Then Faux’s voice, lower, softer. “You’re too generous, Lord Drask.”</p><p>I turned my attention back to Mysha and the crone. </p><p>“— slave once too. I used to get beat in the name of the Light by my master. But I was freed, I can see it now!” Mysha pleaded. “Drask is lying to you, the Light wouldn’t want you suffering like this. If not for yourself, do it for these children.”</p><p>The old crone shook her head, “We’ve got to obey the Light, if that means servin’ our masters, that’s what we’ll do. Until it sends for us, we’re stayin’. Now leave ‘fore I call for the guard.”</p><p><em>No wonder Father fled for the North</em>, I thought. Tired of the people stuck in their own loop of self-pity, unable to see the chains bound around their necks. <em>They’re weak, and weak people don’t deserve my effort—my blood</em>, I thought bitterly. </p><p>“Fine, stay here. Let us take the children, we’ll give them a better chance at life than you did,” I snarled at the old woman.</p><p>“What’s wrong with your eyes, boy,” she croaked, pulling back. </p><p>“What if The Light sent us for you? An answer to your prayers,” Mysha said softly.</p><p>“You’re askin’ me to sin,” the crone whispered, shaking. “The greatest sin—disobedience. We start disobeyin’ our masters, soon we gonna be disobeyin’ The Light.”</p><p>“I’ve kept us safe, kept us blessed.” The crone said, barely above a whisper. She continued her rocking, still shaking her head violently. “Besides, Lord Drask treats us well, needs his company for the evenings. I choose the girls who need blessin’ most. The priests say servin’ the master means servin’ the Light.”</p><p>Mysha’s voice began to break, “You chose them? T-Those girls?” </p><p>My stomach turned. <em>A blessing?</em> She’d cursed those women, who knows how many others there were before.</p><p>A shrill scream pierced the night outside. </p><p>“What’s wrong with his eyes?” one of the slaves muttered to the other in the corner. I was too furious to care.</p><p>“Better than starvin’ on the streets, or workin’ the marshes.” The crone’s one functioning eye kept glancing at me nervously, the other one, pale and unmoving. “Somethin’s wrong with you, boy.”</p><p>“Isela, get away from him!” one of the slaves shouted.</p><p>I creeped toward the crone—Isela—slowly. Her shaking increased as she crawled backward toward the wall, covering her wrinkled face with her shawl.</p><p>She tried muttering something, but her voice trembled with fear. </p><p>“Demon! Demon!” Isela bellowed. “You’ve been sent to tempt us!”</p><p>“Quiet!” I hissed. “Mysha, we have to warn Faux and the others. We have to leave, now.”</p><p>She looked between me and the old crone, her voice quivered, “What—we’re supposed to just leave them? Look at what they’ve done to them!” her voice pitched.</p><p>“I can’t, I can’t leave yet!” Mysha continued. She turned to the other two slave girls, pleading, “Please, he’s not a demon. I can help you, we can protect you.” </p><p>They just shook their heads with widened eyes.</p><p>All for nothing, we’d come here all for nothing. They were devoted to the lies they’d been sold.</p><p>Amidst the crone’s desperate screams, I heard Drask’s voice from below “Should I call for the women, only the finest for—what the hell is that noise, disturbin’ the peace.” His voice quaked with rage.</p><p>“It’s from upstairs, Father,” someone said, must’ve been a guard.</p><p>“Go quiet them now—aggravatin’ our guests,” he yelled.</p><p>Heavy boots thundered up the stairs. </p><p>Mysha’s eyes met mine—we were out of time. </p><p>I moved to the doorway and looked down. Two guards had made it halfway up the stairs.</p><p>Then a loud crashing sound as the main door burst open. I could barely make out Kerra from where I hid, stomping the floor as the guards dragged her to Drask. Blood seeped from a gash on her head, her hands were bound by the guards.</p><p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Drask demanded.</p><p>“Saw this bitch cuttin’ the locks to the barracks, Lord.”</p><p>“How many?” His pockets of fat rolled as he strutted up to her. “How many did you release?”</p><p>Horror creeped into his voice.</p><p>“Most of them, Father. She killed four of our brothers too,” one of her captors said.</p><p>Drask pummeled his fist into Kerra’s jaw, but she took it like a true bellator—didn’t flinch, didn’t scream. My hand immediately went to my  beetle bow, which hung at my belt. I donned the bow on my hand, the hold fitting me like a glove. I nocked the arrow and let it loose.</p><p>The shaft of the arrow punctured the closest guard’s throat, blood spilling out of his neck. He toppled on top of the other one, sending them both tumbling down the stairs.</p><p>Every head snapped toward me.</p><p>Drask turned to look up at me. His eyes widened, then narrowed as he looked between me, Faux and Kerra. His face twisted with understanding. </p><p>“What is all this? Who are you bastards?” He snarled.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Was the freedom we provided preferable over bondage? Was it even freedom if we chose for them? </p><p>No, it wasn’t. </p><p>We barged in, shattered their world, ripped off their chains, and disappeared. It was just like my capture from Nothello—no choice on my part, yet it was easier to pose the decisions that followed as my own. </p><p>The violence—the pain that followed suit, didn’t matter. We’d be branded as heroes, while the dead cursed us from their graves. Their memories were forgotten, while our glory surged. </p><p>Just like the Sargaryns did at the dawn of the path, we’d decided that autonomy was superior to subservience.</p><p>I can still hear Faux’s blade, the sound of steel scraping steel as he drew his sword.</p><p>“Haven’t you heard, old man, Withdrawal was two decades ago.” Kalandyr followed suit, drawing his own sword. “Slaves have been outlawed.”</p><p>The guards, all clean-shaven bald, rushed to protect their Lord Father, forming a wall of men all around him. They pointed their spears outward, daring any of us to come forth. </p><p>“Merchants from Greyport, eh?” Drask said, sparking his pipe with a quick puff. “I gave you the most delicate courtesies as my guests and you tried to violate my operation.”</p><p>He continued, “You think these dirty toilers want freedom? No, they yearn for leadership, for purpose.” He gestured his hands all around the guards who surrounded him. “My sons know this. They could kill me right now—they certainly outnumber me, could overpower me. But they won’t.”</p><p>He smiled and took a puff from his pipe slowly, letting the smoke swirl around him. “Because they understand what you never will. Freedom’s a curse for those too weak to wield it.”</p><p>Not one guard flinched. No one turned back to look at him, their eyes were set on us. Mysha trembled with rage beside me at the bloodied sight of Kerra. </p><p>“Now, I will show you what my sons can do.” He took another long puff, this time blowing the smoke right into one of his <em>son’s</em> faces. “Their corpses, bring them to me, and let us make an example for anyone who dares to dishonor my hospitality.”</p><p>He turned and flounced out of the main door, boots heavy on the stone floor. The two guards holding Kerra dragged her after him, her blood leaving a trail behind them. </p><p>“Take this one to the post,” I heard Drask bark from outside, followed by Kerra’s muffled shouting. </p><p>As Drask left, more of his guards pooled into the manor. Almost a dozen of them, and four of us. </p><p>They attacked immediately, splitting into two groups. One for Faux and Kalandyr, the other for me and Mysha upstairs. A silent unison between all of them.</p><p>Their heavy boots thudded on the stairs as they rushed up, spears pointed toward us. The bound women made no noise, no movement as the guards thundered past them.</p><p>The two in front thrust their spears toward me, careful in keeping their distance from my blade. I weaved between them, the points slipping by my sides, and jabbed my own blade toward one of their throats. A third spear swatted my blade away like a fly and a fourth lunged for my chest. I brought down my knife with all the strength I had, deflecting the tip of the spear. Just enough to create some distance and back away toward the chained woman.</p><p>For once, I wasn’t overwhelmed by the sounds  and what I saw. The Sight had helped me catch the rapid movements—without it, I’d have been dead. These men were trained, unlike the inadequate bandits who’d simply picked up copper and called it blades. </p><p>I had to end it fast, get to Kerra. I could hear her screaming in the distance, Drask’s voice barking orders I couldn’t make out.</p><p>My eyes caught the flurry of movement on the other end of the halfway. The other two guards were on Mysha. Their spears glinted in the warm candlelight as they sent powerful jabs toward her, she deflected them—barely. One grazed her shoulder. </p><p>The remaining four marched toward me in the narrow hall. A spear plunged toward me, I knocked it aside with my sword—too hard, too wild. The tip veered off its course and tore through one of the chained women’s shoulders. She gave a breathy wheeze before collapsing into her shackles.</p><p>The guard pulled his spear back out with his lip curled in disgust, the blood spewing across the wall.</p><p>Another whirl of jabs came at me—to my left, my right, above me. I couldn’t keep pushing back, they were pressing me close to the stairs. </p><p>I caught a glimpse of the scene below, Kalandyr spun around his opponents with wild fervor but utmost precision. His limbs moved like that of a spider trapping its prey. He swerved between two spears that thrust at him and in one smooth motion, drove his blade across two of the men’s’ throats.</p><p>The guards came at me again. I tumbled forward, slipping beneath the point of their spears, and swung my blade in a wide arc, catching one in the leg. The muscles of his leg spasmed as he grunted in pain, dropping his spear. A quick slash across his stomach left him soaking in his blood. </p><p>I flipped my knife in my grip and hurled it, with as much precision as one can in chaos. The blade spun wildly in the air before burying itself between the eyes of one of the guards. His eyes rolled back and his hands reached toward his head and trembled, before he toppled down. </p><p>The third guard roared and lunged at me. His spear punched through the side of my thigh. My vision went white as the pain shot up my leg and I grabbed my leg with my free hand, screaming. The fourth guard shook his head in contempt and turned toward Mysha, spear raised. </p><p>It was just a duel now, me and the one guard. I wiped the blood on my trouser. His eyes tightened as he glanced at the two corpses by his feet. Whatever loyalty he had to Drask, wavered for just a moment.</p><p>Long enough.</p><p>I reached forward and swung my blade down his head, splitting his face down the middle. He dropped with a loud thud, his spear clattering on the floor. </p><p> The chained women looked at me blankly, as if the corpses and the blood pooling around them weren’t there. The one who’d been struck was unconscious, her blood dripped down her shoulder, pooling with the guards’.</p><p>A thunder of footsteps rumbled outside, and an influx of raspy voices. </p><p>I wrenched the knife free from the dead guard's forehead, gripped the blade firmly in my hands and pulled myself up, wincing with each step. Mysha backed toward the room where Isela continued her pointless screaming. One of the guards lay at Mysha’s feet, his face a bloodied mess. The other two edged toward her. </p><p>Pounding shook the door outside and voices roared with rage. </p><p>Then, the door crashed, the wood split off its hinges as a mass of people flooded through the door. A cacophony of shrieking and wordless fury came with them. </p><p>The freed slaves. </p><p>They were armed with crude weapons, if one could even call it that. Salt rakes, shovels, dredging poles, spades, whatever they could find. The crowd rushed in with no sense of formation or order. Pure chaos. </p><p>In the horde, I saw thin-limbed and hollowed eyed children no older than eight or nine, screaming at the top of their lungs, desperate sounds of the terrified.</p><p>Faces that should’ve been playing in the mud, not the blood. For a moment, I saw Daryen among them, screaming and charging toward a guard. He darted toward the guard, swinging a hook in his hands and before he’d made three strides, the long shaft of a spear protruded out of his chest. </p><p>The hook slipped out of his small hands as he crumpled to the floor. Not Daryen, just a boy. Same dark hair and small frame. But a stranger’s face, forever frozen in anguish.</p><p>The guard yanked his spear free from the child’s body and moved to the next target without looking back. No regards.</p><p>I stood there frozen. <em>Not Daryen</em>, I repeated to myself. Just another mother’s dear son. </p><p>But we’d brought them this hell.</p><p>A sharp scream pierced my thoughts. </p><p>Mysha.  </p><p>I turned to look at the mess of limbs around her. She was locked in a clash with one of the guards. The other stood nervously behind, hesitating in fear of striking his brother. With one hand pressed down on my leg, I limped towards Mysha. Each passing step sent a sharp pain up my back. </p><p>My knife flew from my hands as I flung it at the one colliding with Mysha. It nudged itself deep into the wall behind him, barely missing my mark. I nearly fell as I stumbled forward and swung my blade down the distracted guards back. Not deep enough.</p><p>The pain was getting to me, but it wasn’t over yet. Kerra was still out there.</p><p>Downstairs I heard the sound of rattling and banging, the sound of screams and cries.</p><p>The man’s back arched. He sucked in a deep breath, sharp and wet, and his grip on the spear faltered. Blood seeped through his red tunic where my blade left its mark. The cut wasn’t deep enough to kill him, but deep enough to hurt. </p><p>He turned slowly, his teeth bared and lip curled. Mysha pushed back against her opponent and slipped into the room behind her, he thundered after her, leaving me and the last guard in the hallway.</p><p>We each stood there, wincing with the pain of our respective injuries. Blood dripped off the wounds on my skin, while beads of sweat lined my forehead. </p><p>“Come at me, heretic.” He breathed hard, his back still arched but his spear pointed straight.</p><p>I didn’t move. His spear beckoned me forward, so it could make nice holes in my body, but I didn’t move. My leg started to tremble and I shifted my weight to the other, locking my knee in an awkward stance. </p><p>I limbed forward, step by step and he pressed further back, his shoulder hitting the wall. He shoved his spear at my throat, my legs faltered, and I diverted the spear with my sword to my right. It grazed my shoulder, not deep, but blood seeped across my tunic. </p><p>He’d been trained, but training wasn’t the same as fighting for your life. Every move of his was backed with uncertainty. </p><p>His eyes met mine and I sort of grasped what Kalandyr was trying to teach me earlier. I saw fear swirling in his eyes. Not enough to read his moves, but enough so that I knew his hesitation would be his defeat. </p><p>I feigned right with my blade, and he pressed it away with the shaft of his spear, leaving me open. I dared him to take the oppurtunity—he hesitated, but he did. He poked his spear at me—weak and uncertain— and I batted it aside with my free hand, gripping the shaft. My blade found its way down his chest. </p><p>“Rand’ar!” Mysha rushed forward, her leg soaked with blood. I peered behind her, the other guard’s blood was draped across the wall in the other room. Isela had gone quiet and had opted for prayers instead. Mysha’s eyes glanced between my leg and shoulder nervously.</p><p>“How bad is it?” I asked her.</p><p>“Bad enough.” She pulled out a piece of fabric from her pack and wrapped it tightly around my thigh. “This’ll stop the bleeding for now, but you’ll need a proper doctor for this.”</p><p>She bandaged my shoulder after, pressing the cloth tight against my skin. The pain didn’t dissipate, but in the heat of the moment I hardly felt it. </p><p>As soon as she finished, I stumbled for the stairs, gripping the railing firmly. </p><p>“Rand’ar, you can’t keep fighting in that state,” her voice shook.</p><p>“They’re going to hang Kerra,” I shook my head without looking back. No time to explain. </p><p>“I’ll come with you—” she started.</p><p>“No,” I cut across. “You unshackle these women, one of the guards must have a key.”</p><p>I turned to look back at her, gesturing to the chained women, their eyes downcast and most of their faces hidden behind matted hair. “You’re better at this than I am. They need someone who understands. I’ll find Kerra. Besides, your leg’s as bad as mine.”</p><p>She nodded quickly and fumbled the guards pockets for a key.</p><p>I walked—tripped down the stairs, leaning on my good leg with each step. Below was chaos incarnate. The freed slaves swarmed around nervously. The first group of guards lay dead, but reinforcements had come. Faux was locked in a fight with two, his sword swung elegantly, deflecting each thrust of the guards’ spears. Kalandyr fought another, his movements precise despite the blood dripping down his forehead. </p><p>I trusted they’d have it handled. </p><p>I slipped out the door where Faux and Kalandyr’s horses were tethered to a post. I nudged Kalandyr’s horse with my hand before hauling myself up on the saddle, hissing as pain flared through my leg. </p><p>Pain seared everywhere in me. Not just my leg and shoulder, but my head and arms as well. The thrill of the battle died and fear settled in its place. The type of fear Father trained me to avoid. But it was inevitable. </p><p>I feared the sight I’d see—Kerra strung up against a pole, her face hammered in like the other corpses we’d seen strung on the road.</p><p>The freed slaves, they’d fought in the end. Stood brave with us<em>.</em> <em>But why hadn’t they revolted on their own?</em></p><p>I kept nudging my horse down the road, only the twin moons and the pale stars lighting our path. As we trotted further from the manor, the disorderly sounds of battle faded into the night, and was replaced with the sounds of insects chirping away.</p><p>I rushed the horse down the road, worried that I was too late—that they’d already finished and ran for it. But in the distance, off the beaten path, I heard hissed shouting. Drask.</p><p>I slipped off the horse and followed the sound, careful to stay low and behind the shrubs. They stood in the clearing. Drask towered over Kerra, who was bound to a pole.</p><p>He was demanding something, but I couldn’t quite make it out without getting closer. I creeped closer, inch by inch, my blow gloved and the arrow loaded. </p><p>“How many others are there?” Drask growled, he’d lost the sense of calm confidence he’d had at the manor earlier.</p><p>“Who else knows about my operation?” he pressed on. “Tell me, or I’ll nail your other hand next. My sons won’t hesitate to spill blood.”</p><p>Kerra stood in defiance against him, her one hand had a large iron spike nailed through into the pole. </p><p>One of the guards held her other hand in place, while the other raised a hammer tauntingly.</p><p><em>The bastards</em>. I only wish I could’ve shown them the scene of their dead brothers sprawled over the floor back in the manor.</p><p>I took aim with my bow, targeting the one with the hammer. I took a long breath and pressed down on the trigger. The arrow whizzed through the air and lodged itself into his shoulder. </p><p>He doubled over, grunting in pain as Drask and the other guard looked around expectedly for me. </p><p>The guard clutched his shoulder, tracing the path of the arrow back to me. His eyes widened and he pointed. “There!”</p><p>I drew my blade out of its hold, and stumbled forward. Two guards, one wounded, one fresh. And Drask. </p><p>“How the hell did you—” He looked past me back at the manor. “The guards—”</p><p>“Are all dead. Or rather, being finished off as we speak.” I pointed my blade between the two guards, “Let her go. Your guards are dead. Your slaves freed. My people will be here any moment.”</p><p>“Oh really, I don’t see them here. Looks to me like once we finish you, a message to Greyport will have the King's soldiers combing these marshes for your friends.\"</p><p>I looked at Kerra defeatedly, she only shook her head. This wouldn’t end without blood being spilt. </p><p>The uninjured guard yanked his spear out of the dirt and charged at me. Despite my worn state, I read his attack like a book—a quick parry left him reeling into the dirt. </p><p>I was stuck between them. The wounded and the unwounded. They both circled me, one’s brow furrowed at me while the other watched me with skepticism. </p><p>They both thrust their spears at the same time, I knocked one aside and twisted away from the other, putting too much weight on my wounded leg. Pain shot up my thigh and my knee buckled. </p><p>I almost collapsed in the mud right there. Each ounce of pain built on top of the other, pushing me to give up. Standing was an agony, and fighting was anguish. It was easier to lie down than go on.</p><p>“Finish it, boys.” Drask shouted from the side. His blade remained in its hilt, as if he couldn’t be bothered to help finish it himself. A task too lowly for him.</p><p>Kerra's hand hung from the pole, the blood seeped down onto her head. She watched me with uncertainty, unsure of what to do. </p><p>“Up, Rand’ar! Move!” She hissed at me. “The wounded one favours his right! Go left! They die or we do—” </p><p>Drask whipped his hand across her face, “Quiet, girl.”</p><p>She was right, the wounded one circled to my right, the arrow still lodged in his shoulder. He gargled up blood and spat it out, wiping it with his free hand. </p><p>I pushed myself up with my legs. <em>One last fight</em>, I told myself. A lie to get through it. But my body followed suit. My breath whistled as it escaped me.</p><p>They both charged at me again, but this time, the moment seemed to slow down. I saw the spittle flying out of the wounded one’s mouth as he roared, the end of his spear dragging along the ground, kicking up mud with it. The other stormed toward me with his thick brow furrowed. </p><p>My eyes locked onto theirs as they both came at me head on. The wounded one had a desperate look, like a drowning man gasping for air. The other wore an air of confidence, his strike well telegraphed. </p><p><em>The eyes—like Kalandyr had said. It was all in the eyes!</em> My vision sharpened in the night and despite the pain, the fatigue, I saw everything. I saw Kerra digging her free hand at the nail, wrenching to pull it free. Drask bellowed something at the guards, some threat of what he’d do if they failed. I heard it, but it didn’t matter. The guards pointed their spears at my chest, to strike me, but I saw them. Not just their bodies—their intent, their attack before it ever happened.</p><p>It was as if I saw the truth of the world, my eyes and limbs worked in synced tandem. My limbs reacted faster than my eyes, I could see clearly then.</p><p>In that moment, I was in tune with my Essence—with The Sight. The guards thrust their spears at me, but I parried each strike away with swift ease, returning the favor by piercing their chests, their throats, their guts—wherever my blade found purchase.</p><p>Each strike left my blade bloodier, and their bodies more ravaged. With the last of my strength, I swung my blade at each of their necks, ending their petty lives. Their blood sprayed in my face and they tumbled down at my feet. </p><p>I stumbled back and dropped to my knees to catch my breath, the pain all catching up to me, before I heard a strange crunching sound. </p><p>Kerra had torn the nail free out of her hand. She’d pounced at Drask, pinned him to the ground and drove the nail deep into Drask’s skull. The mush of his brains flew out with each strike, splattering on her bloodied face. Over and over again, long after he’d stopped moving. </p><p>I let her finish.</p><p>Eventually her barbarity subsided. She gripped the nail tightly above Drask’s head, letting it slip from her hands. Her injured hand limped at her side as she slipped off his corpse, staring into the mud.</p><p>I stared at my own wounded hands in disgust, the pain and the guilt seeped into me. Six men I’d killed that day, and another the night before. Is this the path Father ran from—the one Astaron warned me of, yet sent me on anyway. </p><p><em>Defy the blade</em>, he’d said. No resistance had come from me, I’d fallen for its seductive whisperings again. <em>Forget Father, what would Mother think?</em> I asked myself. </p><p>I shook my head fiercely, I didn’t have time for those kinds of thoughts. They were the thoughts of free men, of believers who worried about sin and guilt and penance. </p><p>My worries were more immediate—about survival. And the violence had come with a purpose.  Who was to say that those wretched souls hadn’t deserved it. The guards were Marshin themselves— had turned on their own people and punished them for trying to leave, strung them up like meat.</p><p><em>This was necessary</em>, I affirmed to myself. We’d freed hundreds, whether they’d wanted it or not. </p><p>A groan pulled me back to the mud. Kerra, clutching her mangled hand. She looked at me, face pale, jaw tight. </p><p>“Can you ride?” I looked up at her.</p><p>She nodded once.</p><p>I pushed myself off the ground, grimacing and snarling with each limping step back toward the horse. I hauled myself up onto the horse, every muscle screaming in protest. I helped her up and she grabbed my shoulder with her one good hand, the other hung loosely off the side. The manor awaited in the distance, the lights inside dancing against the dark ink of night.  </p><p>We rode back in silence.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The first lights of dawn creeped in over the horizon as I sat on the stone steps leading up to the manor. Mysha moved between the wounded slaves, her leg trembling with each step. </p><p>My own injuries throbbed—where the spear had gone through, bandaged tight but still seeping. </p><p>The freed slaves huddled in small groups, some tending to injuries, others deep in worried talk about what comes next. </p><p>A small boy, no older than ten, approached me. His hands fidgeted at the hems of his ragged shirt, at the holes and the stained seams. He stopped a few feet away, glancing nervously at me.</p><p>“My mother said I should thank you,” he said quietly, eyes fixated on the ground. “So thank you, for freeing us.”</p><p>I wasn’t sure if we’d freed them, so I only nodded once.</p><p><em>Mother</em>. The word struck me like a drummer hitting the cymbal. </p><p>Astaron had once told me that Sephyra was more than just the wife of Haestus—more than just my mother. She was a raised woman, people came to her for blessings. For guidance when all seemed lost. When she left for North with Father, the rebellion lost more than a guiding figure, they’d lost their faith.</p><p>But I didn’t like thinking of her that way. To everyone else, she was a symbol. To me, she was just my mother. The one who comforted me when I needed her most.</p><p>One memory stood out from the rest. It was when I was around eight. My parents had forbidden me and my siblings from making friends in school. Too dangerous, they’d said. They didn’t want people asking questions about why Marshin were in the North. </p><p>I never understood why. I’d come home crying and furious, seeing the other kids laugh and converse—seeing them happier than me. </p><p>On the days I felt worse, I’d often climb up to the roof of our home and watch the people in the streets bustling about. I saw children playing and chasing each other down the teeming thoroughfare.</p><p>One day, my mother found me up there and sat down with me. She asked me what was wrong. </p><p>After much reluctance, I told her. She listened quietly, nodded along like she understood. Then she stood up and held out her hand.</p><p>“Come with me,” she said.</p><p>I took it and we walked down from the roof and through the streets together. Her hand was warm around mine and I stayed close. She didn’t ask more questions, didn’t try to fix it with words. We just walked until we’d reached a bakery at the corner of the market square. </p><p>I remember jumping up the steps and picking out three of the pastries. We went up to the terrace to eat. The sun set in the horizon, light spilling down on Mother’s auburn hair. The sounds of chatter and people filled the square below. </p><p>I finished one, savouring it, the rest remained uneaten on the table. When I finished eating, she leaned in over the table and told me something that stuck with me.</p><p>“I have loved you long before you were born and will love you long after I’m gone. If you ever feel alone, remember me, remember this moment. I’ll always be with you.”</p><p>She cupped my hands in hers, “One day, Rand’ar, you will help shape a world where children like you need not hide. Remember that.”</p><p>I nodded along like I understood. I didn’t, but I was just happy to be there with <em>my</em> mother. </p><p>I wasn’t sure I understood it then on those silent steps either. We’d freed most, but left the others screaming in their graves. I thought of the dead children and the ones left orphaned. The guards had held little restraint against the frail slaves. This wasn’t the world I wanted.</p><p>The sight of Daryen screaming like a madman and jumping into the fray of violence kept creeping back every time I closed my eyes.</p><p>I hugged my knees tighter, my sword lay beside me. The blood had dried and left an odd smell of meat and metal. It would need to be cleaned soon.</p><p>Kerra wandered aimlessly behind Mysha, her hand wrapped with thick bandages. Her screams had torn through the night as Mysha applied strong liquor on the wound, while some of the slaves prayed around Kerra for her survival. </p><p>Faux settled in beside me, clearing his throat. His breath smelled of stale smoke and coffee, “It’s gonna be a long time ‘fore these folk heal from this.”</p><p>“Hmm,” I grunted, not in the mood to talk.</p><p>“Kalandyr’s been trainin’ you well, hasn’t he? Heard you took down six of the guard.” He turned with a small smile.</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>He stayed quiet for a long aching moment, fidgeting with the hilt of my blade. He rolled the long blade in his hands, saw the blood and set it back down.</p><p>“I know things didn’t turn out so well. Lots of folk dead. But we did a good thing here, Rand’ar. We can direct these people to one o’ the other colonies, have ‘em rebuild.”</p><p>I nodded quietly. I couldn’t shake the feeling we’d made things worse. The orphaned children, the broken families, it would be just like my own. Lost and alone in a dangerous world itching to kill us.</p><p>One of the freed slaves, a young woman in a long gown and a tattered head wrap bowed low in front of us.</p><p>“May the Light bless your path, sirs.” She said quickly. </p><p>“We’re just doin’ what’s right, miss.” Faux beamed, waving as she hurried back to a group of women. They whispered and giggled as she returned.</p><p>“Without what we’ve done here, these folk would’ve toiled on for Drask. Now they’ve got the choice to choose their own path forward.” He patted me on the back, “You helped give ‘em that choice. Be proud of yerself.”</p><p>I felt no pride, but something more tempered. Resolved. </p><p>Like I could tell myself what we’d done was better than the alternative. We’d freed hundreds, given them agency. Astaron had always drilled in our heads that violence was the only answer to the eternal regime of the Sargaryns. It wasn’t the violence that deterred me, but the sense that it was pointless.</p><p>I’d never seen a Sargaryn. Even the lowest of their patricians were all holed up in the high Citadel. Their eyes watching all, domineering over all. </p><p>But we’d struck something real. Drask was dead, his guards with him in the afterlife. His slaves freed. We’d done something tangible.</p><p>I watched the free people move about. Some tended to wounds, others stood around, uncertain of what comes next. Part of me will never understand the adults who’d clung to their chains, clawing at the familiarity of bondage. </p><p>They needed that push. In that moment, I was glad we’d made the choice for them. Now they’d have to choose their own path forward. Wherever it may lead, triumph or disaster, the choice would be their own, and that was worth more than all the blood we’d spilled to buy it.</p><p>Kalandyr walked up the steps, bandage wrapped around his forehead. He tilted his head at me before turning to Faux.</p><p>“We need to point these people to Goldwood Colony. They won’t survive these marshes without direction.”</p><p>Faux nodded and got up, shaking off the dirt from his tunic.</p><p>“Eat something, Rand’ar. We’ve got a journey ahead of us.” He pulled a map out of his pack and followed Kalandyr down the steps toward a group of people packing food and supplies into an old rickety cart. </p><p>The chained women from upstairs huddled together in a corner, still silent. The one who’d been speared was alive, her shoulder wrapped in thick bandages. Mysha had freed them, but they looked even more lost than when they were chained.</p><p>After the last of Drask’s guards had been killed, the house slaves made a run for it. They feared the retribution of the freed field slaves. I still remember Isela’s horrid screaming as one of the other women dragged her out of the manor. </p><p><em>You’ve cursed us, boy. You and your damned eyes. Disobedience is the first sin. </em>Mysha’d just shook her head in disappointment.</p><p>They wouldn’t survive in the marshes, not without supplies and a destination in mind.</p><p>I went down the hill to a quiet place, free from the crowd and chatter to clean my blade. At the edge of a small stream, I rinsed the blade and wiped down the last of the blood, careful to keep the leather-hilt dry. After drying it, I slid the blade back into its scabbard and sat there, staring at my reflection in the water.</p><p><em>This is who I am now. Someone who abandoned my family. A monster, a killer. </em>Another voice creeped in, quieter: <em>a freer of slaves</em>. It felt wrong to call myself that, but it was true. The freed Marshin looked at me with admiration. Some of them gaped at me across the hill where I sat. One group waved me over. </p><p>“You sure know how to use that blade of yours, son.” One of them flashed his crooked teeth at me as I approached, shuffling a worn deck.</p><p>Three of them sat in a circle on the soft grass, acting free of any worries, bickering amongst each other about something unimportant.</p><p>“Play with us, boy. Got room for one more.” An older man, voice strained and rough. </p><p>“Alright,” I set down my blade and knelt in the grass beside them.</p><p>Cards, something familiar even in that distant land. I’d stayed up late nights with Tommy and Mirvel. Instead of coin, we’d bet dares. Sneaking extra rations from the kitchens, or anything else that would’ve got us whipped if we were caught. Tommy usually paid up.</p><p>“Where you comin’ from, boy.” The old man croaked.</p><p>“Veylands,” I muttered, sticking to my story.</p><p>“Where from? I been there in my years here and there,” he said. His hands shook as he grabbed his set of cards.</p><p>“Why’s you care, Milo? Just let the boy play with us.” The one shuffling the deck said, handing me my set.</p><p>“I’m just askin’, Jack. Nothin’ wrong with—damn it! Why am I always gettin’ shit for cards.” The others snickered at his misfortune. Each of them held their cards close to their chest, peering at the other, trying to see who’d fold before the game ever began.</p><p>“We’re playin’ Sheeps Tower,” Jack said. “You know it?”</p><p>I nodded. Tommy had taught me it—high sun cards take the hand, low moons beat the straights.</p><p>I studied my own cards, not a bad hand. </p><p>Jack tossed a card into the center, “Alright, let’s see what you boys got.”</p><p>Milo groaned and snatched a card from the deck, adding to his set. “Damn it, already startin’ bad.”</p><p>Jack couldn’t contain himself, a massive grin plastered on his face.</p><p>“You’s hidin’ somethin’, Korin,” Jack nodded at the quiet one.</p><p>Korin had a sly grin on his face, then slammed three of his cards down in the pile. A groan escaped Jack. Milo’s grin widened—at least he wasn’t the only one losing.</p><p>“You’re next, err, what’s your name, boy?” Milo asked.</p><p>“Rand’ar,” I put down a card. The old man kept staring at me, like the name didn’t fit what he’d expected.</p><p>Then, when he realized it’s his turn, he took one look at his set and snatched another card from the deck, muttering something about bad luck.</p><p>“You used up all yours gettin’ that old,” Jack snickered at Milo.</p><p>“Keep talkin’ and you ain’t gonna make it to mine.”</p><p>“Well, none of you’s makin’ it to the end of this game,” Korin jumped in.</p><p>“A quick prayer, and you’ll all be cowerin’ when you see my set.” Old man Milo kissed the back of his cards. </p><p>The banter took me away from my worries. Worries of home, of our mission, if we’d survive the coming struggles. The men in front of me had lived harsh lives—each of them had scars along their arms, and a worn look that made them seem older than they were. A life of long labor. Yet even they were able to find joy in the simplicities.</p><p>Eventually, Korin slammed down the last of his cards, jumping about, kicking up dirt in the air. </p><p>“Rigged from the start,” I muttered, tossing down my cards. I caught myself smiling at Korin’s boyish celebration. <em>When was the last time I’d done that?</em></p><p>“You’re all cheatin’ bastards. I ain’t playin’ with y’all again.” Milo hurled his cards into the dirt. Jack snickered despite his own loss. </p><p>“You’re a brave kid, son. But you ain’t got the knack for the cards,” Jack smirked at me.</p><p>“Like you’s any better,” Milo snapped from behind. “You know boy, you did a heroic thing there. You and your fellows. The others might not say it, but you saved us from that Drask.”</p><p>Korin nodded along quietly, Jack nudged me in the shoulder, “You got the old man gettin’ all soppy.”</p><p>Truth was, I had called this quest a distraction earlier, but seeing these men who I’d barely known invite me to play with them touched me in a way I couldn’t describe. </p><p>“Where will you all go now?” I asked with sincerity. </p><p>“Don’t know. Figure we’ll just go along with the group,” Korin shrugged.</p><p>“Always have,” Jack nodded. </p><p>“What about you, son?” Milo asked, scratching his beard.</p><p>“We’ve got some business in Greyport.”</p><p>“Some business, eh? Well, I hope you give ‘em the hell they deserve.” Jack poked at my ribs playfully. “We’ll pray for you, son. You’ve given us somethin’ we never saw for ourselves.”</p><p>“You gave me something too,” I said, turning away. “Take care of yourselves, just don’t lose all your coin to Korin.” </p><p>I found myself twinged with longing as I walked away. But unlike before, I awaited the trials ahead in Greyport. Astaron had put us on this mission for a reason. A nation of subservient people whose chains had faded but still clung to their necks needed us. </p><p>I clutched the hilt of my sword, inspected it one last time before attaching it to the leather belt on my hip. </p><p>Whatever tyranny awaited us in Greyport—whatever wickedness, my sword would be ready. The path was ordained, I just had to walk it. Some men would bear witness to my guided steel. Others would fall to it.</p>"

      "content": "<p>“Your objective is straightforward,” Astaron pressed over the aged map table in the dark chamber. The candlelight flickered across his stern face. Faux stood beside him, studying a map of the kingdom of Greyport, with a big circle around the city of Walstose.</p><p>“You will pose as emissaries on behalf of our King Salem of The Veylands. The previous ruler broke trade relations with Greyport, opting for hostility. You will approach the seated king of Walstose, broker a peace between our two nations and offer to renew trade as it once were before the Withdrawal.”</p><p>“The Synod will be your greatest obstacle. They have eyes in every court, ears in every room, they <em>must</em> not discover your true objective. You must identify their agents in Walstose and neutralize them before they report to the Citadel.”</p><p>A knot formed in my stomach. The Consecrated Sargaryn Synod. Just the name of it sent chills down my spine. The Synod is what keeps the royal powers in line, ensures that they bend to the wills of the Sargaryn masters. </p><p>“Won’t the Citadel find out eventually?” I asked.</p><p>“They will. Greyport is but a small kingdom, riddled with internal conflicts, they will think this is one of them. When they send more of their Synechs, we will abide by their followings for a while, until we gather strength enough to root out that curse.” </p><p>Astaron eyed each of us grimly. Kalandyr stood with his brow furrowed, Kerra stood next to Mysha, her hand resting on Mysha’s shoulder<strong>. </strong>Faux scratched the scar along his cheek as he bent over the map, tracing our path from The Gauntlet to our objective. I folded my arms and leaned against the cold stone wall.</p><p>“Once you’ve infiltrated the court, you must divert the city guards away from the king, at which point I will bring in the strongest of our forces and we will seat the next king of Greyport.”</p><p>“What about reinforcements?” Faux butted in. “Do we have any support from the Veylands?”</p><p>“The Veylands is still unstable, I must divert my attention there for the time being.”</p><p><em>The Veylands campaign, the one Astaron told me I wasn’t ready for. I waited for two months as Kalandyr and the others marched off to storm the kingdom, and placed our own puppet, Salem.</em> <em>Astaron had learned a trick or two from our Sargaryn persecutors.</em></p><p>“I cannot spare any forces for you, the conquest is too recent. You will have contacts in Walstose you can trust.” Astaron stood up straight and met Faux’s gaze, “Get this finished, brother, and we will be one step closer to achieving Haestus’ vision.” </p><p>Father’s vision. Despite his patronizing of Father’s abandonment, he still worked toward their shared vision. The one I still did not share. </p><p>Faux nodded slowly, “We’ll get it done.”</p><p>As the others filed out, Astaron motioned me to stay back. He stayed silent a long while, pondering and studying the map. I opened my mouth to speak and he interrupted me before I got a word out.</p><p>“You are still our prisoner, Torin Haestus.” <em>Son of Haestus.</em></p><p>He looked at me with a fierce gaze. His eyes searched through the purple of my own. I stared back defiantly. “I am allowing you to undertake this assignment, but I warn you, Faux and Kalandyr have been instructed to kill you if you try to sabotage or abandon the operation.”</p><p>I pushed back his threat, I had no intention to leave—not yet. “And if we succeed? When I come back, you’ll tell me about how Father achieved The Withdrawal?”</p><p>He hissed a simple, “Yes,” and waved his hand, instructing me to leave the chamber.</p><p>That briefing was two weeks earlier. After I left the room, I remember Kerra looking me up and down, holding me with contempt. Her cold eyes stared at me like I was dead weight she’d have to carry.  But after Drask’s, something changed. She'd nod at me when our eyes met. Respect.</p><p>The sky had changed from cloudy to perpetuate gray, soft rain pouring into the cracks of the stone.</p><p>Our horses trotted along the road toward the gates of the port city. The road had transitioned from mud to cobblestone as we approached the gates, the horses snorted at the hard surface, kicking up rainwater with each step. </p><p>The big wooden panels of the gate were swung wide and inviting, with layers of aging stone lining the sides. The gatehouse bridge ran above, watch towers erected on either side. Two guards stood watch on the bridge, bored and inattentive. One leaned over the railing, smoking a rolled leaf, while the other barked a harsh laugh.</p><p>We passed through the gate uneventfully, just one of many merchants and travellers passing through the city. Only we alone would be plotting against it.</p><p>From one danger to the next, it seemed like this was all my life. How I longed for home, to see Remi and the others again. I wondered if Daryen would even recognize me. Would he run into my open arms like he used to? Or would he turn the other way when he saw my scarred hands. </p><p>The port city sprawled before us. Somewhere out there, ships left for the North every day. I pushed the dark thoughts away.</p><p>In the street, the people bustled about, some vendors shouting about whatever oddments they were selling, while others begged for food on their knees. Amidst the downpour, I saw farmers stringing along carts filled with bags of rice, escorts eyeing travellers with batty eyes and scant clothes, leaving little to the imagination.</p><p>In the swarming crowd, I spotted a hooded man who stood in the far corner of the street, eyeing us wearily. I trotted up to Faux and nudged him in the side.</p><p>“Faux,” I muttered, nodding my head toward the man closing in on us. Faux had already noticed him.</p><p>“It’s fine, he’s one of ours,” Faux said calmly.</p><p>He spread his arms as the man approached, as if to embrace the man. “Ahh, Rowan, good seein’ ya.” </p><p>The hooded man stopped short of Faux’s horse, keeping his voice low, “You are late.”</p><p>“You see, time’s a subjective thing. You wouldn’t call a kid born today late, would ya?” Faux chuckled.</p><p>Rowan stared back unamused, his hood clouded most of his darkened face. Rain dripped down the sides of his hood.</p><p>“We err, we ran into some trouble on the way,” Faux turned to look at me, Kalandyr and the girls with a sharp glance. “We took care of it though, won’t be a problem no more.”</p><p>“We are behind schedule.” Rowan said quickly.  You will have to meet the king today, he has been expecting you.”</p><p>No respite for us. A day and a half’s journey out of Drask’s to Walstose, and immediately into the machinations.</p><p>“I don’t care why you are late, but the king will ask. This isn’t a good look for us, so you better have a good excuse prepared. His guard wouldn’t mind putting our heads on display for dishonoring the king’s hospitality.” He said, pulling his hood lower over his face.</p><p>“We’ll think of somethin’, don’t worry.” Faux said, waving away the man’s worries.</p><p>“Don’t worry? I’ve been here for two years working shifts at the docks and mucking the stables. Don’t worry, you say? I’ve been gathering scraps of information while you sat clean in The Gauntlet. If you walk in there unprepared and insult the king for his time, all of those years mean nothing—and we’ll hang for it.”</p><p>“We’re only two days behind schedule,” I muttered. It was that detour to Drask’s and other complications that had hindered our arrival.</p><p>“Yes! Two days! That’s enough to disgrace the king, humiliate our own. What kind of envoys come late to treat with a foreign ruler?”</p><p>None of us could say anything. The man felt satisfied winning the argument and with a hiss he turned and started walking up the street.</p><p>The hooded man—Rowan—guided us through the thick crowd and wet roads, pushing carts and people aside roughly to make room for our horses.</p><p>On either side of the wide boulevard, stood old rickety wooden edifices. The buildings stood short and of shabby make, crudely assembled together. Each building leaned slightly on one side, propped against its neighbor as if it’d collapse without the extra support. No design went into these shoddy buildings—no planning, just wood thrown together for shelter.<strong> </strong>A far distance from the glorious structures I’d expected in a city of this size. </p><p>Children huddled under the stairs of one establishment, mud and soot were engrained in their hands. Some slept under the covering, while others dragged buckets and tools. One reached up and knocked on the door.</p><p>In some ways, the city could not be more different from Nothello, the people poorer and the buildings shoddier. In Nothello, it seemed as if every building was designed by an artist, each structure was held up by magnificent stone and were adorned with towering arches. The men would wear linen suits with tall hats while the women wore long gowns, embroidered with depictions of the twin moons. </p><p>In Walstose, the men wore loose flowing garbs that were stained or ragged while the women wore tattered shawls and faded skirts that dragged through the mud. </p><p>My eyes scanned the streets for any signs of the Synod, but I found only the bustle of merchants, the clatter of worn carts, and the murmurs of locals.</p><p>“You have the letter at least, yes?” Rowan turned his head to look at Faux while still trudging forward. Faux only nodded back. </p><p>Behind me, Mysha whispered to Kerra, “I didn’t think cities got this big.\"</p><p>“Look,” a sound of awe escaped her as she pointed up at a tower that stood above the rooftops in the distance. Unlike the dilapidated shacks that flanked the street, the tower was made of stone. It stood proud above the rest of the city. </p><p>“Still nothing compared to The Gauntlet,” Kerra shrugged. Her injured hand remained wrapped in thick bandages, hanging limply off the side of her horse—no treatment could cure a nail through the palm.</p><p>The boulevard winded up a hill and as the king’s palace came into view, so did the surrounding architecture. The closer we got, the more striking the buildings became. </p><p>The wooden structures were replaced with towering stone walls. We passed under arches and in between lofty estates. The guard became more present as well. They stood in pairs, posted around each corner. They stood still as statues in the midst of the pouring rain, as if it was never there.</p><p>They wore leather armor painted in striking red, water gleaming on their chests. Their arms protected by pointed braces which sat perfectly under the shoulderplates. Their breastplates were made of many layers of leather that were marked by the king’s emblem. </p><p>Each guard had a longsword strapped to their hip, the pommel stamped with the same emblem on their chestplates.</p><p>As we got closer to the centre of the city, the people grew wealthier. They were aristocrats from the North who’d come here for business and to exploit the desperate Marshin. With cheap labor and low standards, it was easy to see why they would conduct their business here. </p><p>A man climbed up onto a heavy cart and barked orders for his two workers to start dragging the cart down the road. The two men were bare chested, the sun gleamed off their backs and sweat trickled down their faces. One stumbled in a dip on the road, and the man lashed him with a stick. I flinched as the sound reverberated off his back.</p><p>A bell rang from somewhere deep in the city. Around us, people paused, some just a heartbeat, while others bowed their heads fully. </p><p>Faux stopped his horse and brought his head low. Behind me, Mysha and Kerra did the same. The hooded man touched two fingers to his brow, whispering an invocation of protection. </p><p>Kalandyr kept his eyes forward, away from the bowed heads. I didn’t move either. </p><p>After a moment, the city resumed its noise. Faux urged his horse onward up the street, and we continued as if nothing had happened.</p><p>We stopped in front of the gates to the king’s palace. Guards were situated along every post. Beyond the gates and the gardens, stood the king’s grand estate. Towering pillars of handcrafted marble jutted at the sky. Arches and stained panes of glass lined the lofty stone walls, some bore images of crowned figures, others showed priests with hands raised to the heavens engraved upon them. Sharp spires pierced the very sky along regular intervals. Buttressed walls and twisting pillars supported the grand structure. </p><p>Around the gates, some people clawed at the guards’ feet, begging to be heard by the king, while others rocked on the floor, hands cupped together, muttering prayers—or curses. </p><p>“Give me the letter, I’ll need to show the stamp for the guard to let us in,” Rowan said with an outstretched hand. Faux gave in reluctantly, pulling a neatly folded paper from his satchel.</p><p>“We’ve got an audience with the king,” Rowan announced plainly to the nearest sentry.</p><p>“Sure, and so’ve all these toilers,” he nodded at the people on the ground, “Get lost before you join ‘em on the ground.”</p><p>Rowan waved the Veylandic seal in front of the man. The sentry’s eyes turned wide then narrowed in anger. “I should have you lot killed right here. I lost two brothers fighting you Veylandic dogs.” The man spat as he pulled out his sword. He tried to snatch the paper from Rowan with his other hand, but Rowan was quicker and pulled it back, one hand hovering over the hilt of his knife.</p><p>“Cede your prejudices, guard. This is a matter between two kingdoms, not you and me. Turn us away now, and explain to your king why his coffers remain empty, why skirmishes still riddle his borders.”</p><p>“Is there a problem here,” another sentry announced loudly from behind Rowan. My hand hovered over my sword, I saw Kerra do the same. Faux held my arm and shook his head. </p><p>“We’ll lose,” he whispered. “Let him take care of it.”</p><p>“Aye,” the first sentry said, his hand still gripping his sword. “This bastard claims he’s from Veylands, and he’s got an audience with the king.”</p><p>“We’ve got a message for peace, and restoring trade. Your king is expecting us.” Rowan bared his teeth and showed the seal again to the second sentry.</p><p>His eyes widened when he saw the seal, “Stand down, Langdon.” He barked at his lieutenant. “The king’s been waiting for these envoys all damn week. You nearly turned away the one thing that might save this damned kingdom.”</p><p>The sentry—Langdon, slid his blade back into its scabbard. “Sorry sir,” he muttered before touching his chest, invoking a prayer. </p><p>“Your weapons, you can’t take ‘em inside,” the man turned to us.</p><p>“Course,” Faux muttered and we handed over our swords. I reluctantly handed over my dagger, but I kept the knife in my boot. I didn’t like going in powerless.</p><p>“Show them the waiting hall, Langdon,” he nodded toward the palace. He turned to all of us and with the rain dripping down the ends of his mustache, he said, “Welcome to Walstose.”</p><p>The heavy metal gates slid open with a loud creak, and our horses slipped through. The crowd tried following us inside but the other guards pushed them back with the threat of their swords.</p><p>We slid off our horses and a pair of servants offered to watch them for us. The gardens brimmed with the most vibrant blooms, and the most flowering fragrances. I looked up at the palace itself, at its secret patios and spiraling columns. Figures moved behind the stained glass windows.</p><p>Langdon led us through the main doors into a long corridor lined with tapestries and rich carpets. </p><p>I was thankful to be free of the constant downpour, but the water had already seeped into every part of my clothes.</p><p>He stopped at a set of wooden doors and pushed them open. </p><p>“You’ll wait here. The king’ll summon you when he pleases.”</p><p>Inside was a narrow hall with a lone bench of stone and a single window overlooking gardens. No decoration, no comfort, and no warmth.</p><p>Langdon lingered a moment in the doorway, his hand hovering over the hilt of his sword. “Two years ago, you mutts attacked our villages on the Western front. My brothers died defending them.” His jaw tightened and his eyes narrowed, “So you'll forgive me if I don't bow and scrape for you Veylandic dogs.\"</p><p>With that he turned away and slammed the door behind him. I heard the faint click of a lock.</p><p>I sighed and sat down in a corner of the room, opting to not be squished between two people on the bench.</p><p>Eventually, Kalandyr settled in beside me. We sat there in silence for a while until the question that had been on my mind came out.</p><p>“You didn’t pray when the bell rang earlier,” I said quietly, the other four were locked in their own conversation. Faux gestured wildly about how Rowan nearly got them killed at the gate.</p><p>“I didn’t,” Kalandyr said flatly.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I don’t believe,” he started, glancing at the door, no doubt fearing the Synod, then back at me. “I don’t believe the Light listens.”</p><p>I shifted against the wall, “But everyone else does, look at Faux.”</p><p>“Faux and the others, they… It’s easier to believe than to feel abandoned. It’s nice thinking someone’s looking over us, but there isn’t. The Light’s forsaken us, and if it hasn’t, it’s been real quiet.”</p><p>He leaned his head back. “Fear and faith look the same from the outside.” </p><p>I thought back to Drask’s, the slaves and how they clung to their chains. <em>Disobedience is the first sin</em>, the old crone had said. It sounded like something a presbyter might preach. “So it’s all just control?”</p><p>“Always has been,” Kalandyr said.</p><p>I wasn’t sure why, but I wanted to argue. Part of me agreed with him, but another part didn’t like the thought that we’d been forsaken. <em>Maybe the Light was guiding us, maybe it had brought me here for a reason, ripped me from home, set me on this path. </em></p><p>“But the freed slaves, they thought we were blessed.”</p><p>“Don’t go there. You’re thinking too much of yourself.” He shook his head, “That’s dangerous.”</p><p>“Dangerous?” I asked.</p><p>His eyes met mine. “You’re not chosen, Rand’ar, you’re just here. Don’t get the two confused.”</p><p>He continued, “The Light didn’t guide us here, we’re not blessed. We’re just killers with a cause.”</p><p>“And if we fail, would it all be for nothing?”</p><p>“Not nothing. We tried.” He paused, then added. “But trying doesn’t free the slaves we left behind, doesn’t bring back the dead.”  </p><p>“Trying doesn’t kill the Sargaryns,” he added more quietly.</p><p>“So then what’s the point? Trying doesn’t matter unless we succeed.”</p><p>“The point <em>is</em> we succeed. Or we don’t, and none of this mattered. That’s it, there’s no divine plan, no one guiding our steps. There’s no greater meaning, there’s only results.”</p><p>“If we fail, the slaves go back to their chains. The dead stay dead, with no meaning for it.”</p><p>“Maybe none,” he said quietly.</p><p>“Unless, there’s something guiding us,” I said faintly. “Something that means it won’t be for nothing.”</p><p>Kalandyr’s jaw tightened and he shook his head, “There isn’t.”</p><p>“You can’t know that for sure,” I said.</p><p>“I do know,” he stood up and brushed off the dirt from his trousers, “And the sooner you can accept that, the better.”</p><p>He left me with bitter thoughts I couldn’t shake. <em>If he’s right, what am I even doing here?</em> <em>If none of it means anything besides the results, then what does it matter if I stay or not. I should just head back home. Somewhere where I mean something—to people who actually care about me.</em></p><p>“Rand’ar,” Mysha said from across the room. She patted the space beside the bench. “Come sit. You’re stressing me out, sitting there like that.”</p><p>I hesitated, before pushing myself off the wall and crossing the room. I took the small space next to her.</p><p>“Rowan,” Faux leaned in forward. “It’s been a few years, eh? Must have some stories to tell. Give us somethin’ while we wait.”</p><p>Rowan pulled his hood back slightly, revealing locks of hair that flowed down to his shoulders. His face was a dark brown and he had darker eyes. A scar ran down from his eye down to his lip, awfully similar to the one on Faux’s. “What kind of story?”</p><p>“You worked the docks, must’ve heard something there,” Kerra said.</p><p>“Right.” He thought deeply for a moment. “I shall give you a sorrowful one. One of the dotards at the dockyard told me this one—said it happened before The Withdrawal.”</p><p>He paused, letting the room go quiet. </p><p>“There was once a young Marshin in service for a great noble in this very city. Early on, the master discovered the boy had a gift, for he could play the harp like no one around. Beautiful, haunting melodies that brought the most hardened men to tears.” Rowan’s voice lowered, “The man dressed his servant in the finest clothes and paraded him like a prized stallion. Every week, after the fourth bell rang, the young Marshin would play for a great crowd in the Risen Square—”</p><p>“Risen Square?” Mysha asked.</p><p>“A reserved square for nobles only. Commoners weren’t even allowed to pass through after sundown.”</p><p>Mysha’s mouth tightened. Kerra’s brow furrowed.</p><p>“One night, the square was particularly crowded, and the boy played the most touching piece. Lords and ladies from across the vast kingdom had heard of his great talent and had come to hear it. As the boy played, his eyes caught those of a young woman standing near the fountain. The daughter of a wealthy dock lord—one of the richest families in Walstose.\"</p><p>He paused.</p><p>I knew where the story was headed and so I turned away.</p><p>“She was beautiful. And she watched him pluck the strings like he was guiding the very stars themselves.”</p><p>“They fell in love?” Mysha asked. Kerra snorted.</p><p>Rowan nodded with a sad smile. “They did indeed. But it had to be in secret, for no noble shall be with a Marshin. They would meet by the docks after dark, long after the city would go quiet, when the workers had gone home and the nobles were deep in their slumber. For months, they kept it hidden, enjoying each other’s company. He never told her he was Marshin—and she thought he was some talented musician, perhaps the bastard son of a lesser noble. He let her believe it, for he loved her, and she loved him.”</p><p>Kerra raised an eyebrow, “She never realized?”</p><p>“How could she?” Rowan said. “He wore the fine fabrics of a noble, played in the squares where no Marshin was allowed. To her, he was just a boy with a harp.”</p><p>He exhaled slowly.</p><p>“Eventually, the girl was with child. And when she told her father she wanted to marry this boy—this musician she loved—it all began to unravel. Her father demanded to know who this boy was, where he was from, what riches did he possess. For his daughter would only marry the finest. When the truth came out…” Rowan shook his head slowly.</p><p>“The girl could not handle it, wouldn’t even believe it at first. Then, the shame began to set in, the disgrace of carrying a Marshin child.”</p><p>The room had gone silent.</p><p>“One morning, after a particularly heavy storm, when the clouds were still grey, and the air still damp. The dockworkers arrived to see the young woman teetering over the edge. The waves were still crashing high, slamming against the wood. They tried to talk sense into her, to make her walk away from the edge, but she threatened to jump if any of them came closer.”</p><p>“So they stayed back. She jumped anyway.”</p><p>No one said a word.</p><p>“The waves held little regard, they took her—took her unborn child with her.” Rowan’s voice was distant. “When the young servant heard what happened, something broke inside him. The dockworkers said his eyes changed, like a dark mist swirled inside the irises. The Abyss had taken him.”</p><p>Faux flinched at the word.</p><p>“What happened to him?” I asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>Rowan met my eyes, “Synod put him down. Couldn’t risk him turning into something worse. So they slit his throat and tossed his body into the waters, perhaps they both found peace in death.”</p><p>He leaned back again, pulling his hood forward.</p><p>“When the girl’s father heard that the workers stayed back, that they didn’t stop her…” Rowan let the thought trail off.</p><p>“So many lives lost because she loved the wrong kind of person. That's Walstose for you.”</p><p>Mysha stared at the floor, Kerra clenched her jaw. Faux cleared his throat but said nothing. Only Kalandyr seemed unbothered, his eyes set out the window.</p><p>Taken by the Abyss, like I almost had—no, I had been taken by it. But I’d pulled back. <em>But he was weak, lost himself for some girl</em>, part of me thought<em>. </em>I know now that the torment of the mind is often a far worse agony than the pain of the body. But I didn’t understand that then.</p><p>Eventually, we all retreated to our own corners of the room as the wait dragged on. The beams of light through the clouded sky crawled down toward the horizon, yet still they did not call for us. A pair of servants came to give us some food, vegetable soup and warm bread that was surprisingly fresh. No meat, but it filled my stomach well enough.</p><p>As the day reached its end, my patience had worn thin. I vowed that whoever would come through the door next, would see the sharp end of my knife unless they got us our audience. Thankfully, the servant who finally appeared, came bearing better news.</p><p>“The King will see you now.”</p><p>I rose, brushing the dust from my clothes and the doubts from my mind. The doubts of our fates. Either we’d be strung like Rowan had said, or we’d be forming an alliance between two nations. The door swung open, and we followed the servant and a group of sentinels down the wide corridor, toward the throne room, toward whatever horrors the Synod had in store.</p>"

      "title": "Chapter 22",
      "content": "<p>Our entourage stepped through the great oak doors and the sentinels swung it shut behind us. The walk ahead was for us and us alone. </p><p>The chamber hall was made in the shape of an arch. Ornate chandeliers hung from the coffered ceiling. Banners lined the walls on either side, faded red and gold, each bearing the royal crest; a crowned serpent coiled around a ship’s mast, gaping back at me. Some looked centuries old, the ends of the banners withered and worn thin by time.</p><p>Guards armed with lances stood at intervals along the walls, still as statues. Courtiers lingered near the walls, some watched us with eager curiosity as we walked toward the raised dais.</p><p>“You are in the presence of the great king of Greyport,” a voice droned from somewhere deep in the hall. “Bow in front of King Stynn the Third.”</p><p>Faux and the others dropped to their knees immediately—I hesitated just a moment—Kalandyr dragged me down by the hems of my shirt. </p><p>He dared not express his contempt, but his eyes were set forward. I followed their trail up to the throne itself. The very platform on which it sat was raised above us, so that all may look up to address the king. It rose above us twice a person’s height, and the throne back reached near the vaulted ceiling. Below the throne, on lesser platforms, were the advisors, each with their own seat looking down upon us.</p><p>High above the throne, chiseled out of the darkest of marble, loomed a figure of The Hand of The Light. Six fingered, no thumb, perfectly formed. Two of its fingers curled downward while the rest pointed to the heavens above. No rings, no engravings, no adornments. The Hand needed none, for we could not truly represent its divinity.</p><p>I couldn’t shake the feeling like it was watching me.</p><p>On the towering throne sat the king himself. An old man—older than Astaron—with greys in his beard and wrinkles on his cheeks. He wore a mantle of crimson red, the hem heavy with gold embroidery that caught the sunlight spilling through the stained glass. </p><p>For a moment he said nothing, then he leaned forward in his seat and lifted his hand—two fingers extended, trembling slightly as they pointed.</p><p>I followed the gesture, expecting to see a guard or courtier, someone behind us.</p><p>But the throne room stretched empty behind our backs.</p><p>His fingers were pointed at me.</p><p>“I’ve seen your kind before,” The king said, his voice steady and resonant. His eyes moved from Kalandyr to me, before narrowing. “Those eyes. Where exactly did King Salem find his emissaries, I wonder.”</p><p>“We’re from The Veylands, Your Eminence,” Faux said, a hint of confusion in his voice.</p><p>“Ah,” the king shook his head. “I was asking the lads behind you.”</p><p>“Our father was in service to King Salem before he passed,” I answered quickly for both of us. I suppose we were brothers then. “We took up his debt.”</p><p><em>The debt Astaron thinks I owe him.</em></p><p>“Debt, you say?” The king paused for a moment, meeting my gaze. “Does King Salem treat you well?”</p><p><em>Was he trying to turn me? Did he know about the Sight? Has the Synod already discovered us?</em> My eyes darted around the many advisors around the grand throne itself, each seated on their own chair, each reaching higher and higher based on their rank. No faces jumped out at me as one of the Synechs, they were all plain and uninterested. Each sat with their arms folded and looked down at us with disdain.</p><p>“He does, Your Eminence,” Kalandyr said plainly. </p><p>“Very well,” King Stynn said, disappointment in his eyes. “State your proposal. What is Salem’s business with us?”</p><p>“Your Eminence,” Faux began, pulling a sealed letter from a satchel. In his most ceremonious voice, he intoned, “Our kingdoms have bled each other for too long. Border raids, skirmishes over trade routes, villages set ablaze on both sides.” He shook his head. “The previous king of The Veylands saw Greyport as a rival to be crushed, lands to be taken, people to be subdued. King Salem does not share his designs.”</p><p>Faux held up the letter, letting the light hit the wax seal.</p><p>“He offers peace. An end to all hostilities. Your Western dukedoms remain yours, we lay no claim to them, no demands for reparations.  In return, he asks only that trade be restored as it was before The Withdrawal. Open ports, fair tariffs and mutual prosperity.”</p><p>The King sat on the back of his seat, leaning his head on one arm. Faux steadied his voice, confident but no trace of arrogance.</p><p>“Greyport was once a jewel of the Eastern coast, a centre for trade and commerce. King Salem believes it can be again, with our two kingdoms as partners, not enemies.”</p><p>“You would speak poorly of your previous king?” Someone from his court spoke up, a boy who sat nearest to the king, dressed in the robes of royalty. I could only take him to be the king’s son.</p><p>Murmurs spread between the many advisors, some turned to whisper in each other’s ear, others remained still and absolute.</p><p>“He was not our king. He was only an iron hand that sent our sons to their deaths in a senseless pursuit for land and coin. We did not share his intentions,” Faux said.</p><p>Stynn paused for a long moment, eyeing each of our entourage, as if searching for something. </p><p>“Guard,” he called out, “Bring me their missive.”</p><p>A guard in crimson armour trudged up to Faux, who, still on one knee, held out the letter. As the guard grabbed the letter from Faux’s hand, I saw his eyes peering at me through the slits of his helm. </p><p>The guard stopped at the base of the many platforms, not even he was to step upon the raised dais. An advisor in flowing dark robes descended the steps, stooped down to grab the letter and carried it up to the king. He dropped to one knee and with his head lowered, he held out the letter before the king.</p><p>King Stynn’s eyes scanned the letter wearily. His eyes widened and narrowed as he read on.</p><p>“Salem would cede the Thorngate region?”</p><p>“In the pursuit of peace, yes.” Faux replied. “King Salem only wishes for the safety and prosperity of his people, if that means returning a land that was once yours back, then he is prepared to pay that price.”</p><p>Faux paused for a moment, perhaps considering what to say next. “Your Eminence, our kingdoms were once the twin pillars of the Eastern coast, let us bring back that glory to—”</p><p>Somewhere deep in the chamber, a great door burst open, slamming against the stone, sending a crack that reverberated in the hall. </p><p>“Ah, The Veylands.” A man’s voice boomed through the hall, bouncing off the gleaming marble. “Such a rich kingdom, filled with river valleys and plains of wheat. Such a beautiful kingdom yet such an abhorrent people.”</p><p>The man’s footsteps preceded him, each one blasting down the marble, a squeaking sound surrounded him, like something dragging along the floor. </p><p>“How many diplomatic negotiations have we had with these people?” Everyone on the raised platforms craned their necks to see who had dared to interrupt. Everyone except the King, whose face remained impassive yet his eyes gleamed with fury.</p><p>“After the battle of The Laymans, where they lynched innocent villagers, they came to treat for harmony, yet broke it within the first year.”</p><p>The man stepped into view beside the platform then. I heard Mysha gasp and Kerra shake her head and turn away in horror. </p><p>A man with jet black hair, smoothly combed back, and a blacker uniform to match. He wore the black vestments of a high cleric, crimson threads tracing the King’s brand across his chest, yet no holy symbol of The Light adorned him<strong>.</strong> A dark cape hung around his neck. By all means the man looked normal, some might even say handsome. If it were not for that repulsive arm that stuck out of his chest. </p><p>The man had only one arm, and it stuck out through the left side of his chest, protruding through his tailored uniform. A green, sickly, veined and bloated arm, the skin stretched tight over the coils and muscles that twitched beneath. The flesh glinted with moisture in the light, mottled with patches of rotted skin, yet the strength in them was undeniable. Thick as a grown man’s thigh and a hand as large as an infant’s body. The arm stretched down below his knees like that of an ape.</p><p>But the horrors did not end there. A repugnant viridescent liquid dripped out of the pores in his hand, pattering against the marble. Two servants—slaves in all but name—dragged beside him, their legs twisted and useless, pulling themselves forward from their bellies like worms. Their fingers clawed at the marble desperately to keep up with the man, writhing desperately to keep pace with his stride. Each of them carried a basin, holding it out to catch every last drop of the bilious liquid, as if the liquid itself might cure them. </p><p>He stooped down beside the platform, his arm reached down and patted, almost tenderly, the head of one of the servants. The poor man tensed up, his eyes went wide with fear before he whispered something inaudible.</p><p>The cleric stood back up and continued around the platform stopping in front of the throne to face us, “What about after the Redstone skirmishes? When their raiding parties crossed our borders, yet when we retaliated, they cried foul and demanded reparations.”</p><p>He turned back to his king. “Emissaries from another kingdom come to sing in your ear, have they now, my king? Have we not heard these tales before?”</p><p>“Archbishop,” the king replied formally, eyes stiff.</p><p>“My king.” The Archbishop bowed his head defiantly. </p><p>Faux, still horrified no doubt, straightened and cleared his throat. “Your Eminence, the… Archbishop speaks of old wounds—and he is right to remember them, but these events were under the dynasty of the old ruler, one who wronged Greyport. We do not deny this.”</p><p>He paused, letting his thoughts catch up.</p><p>“But King Salem is not that man. He holds no intentions of violence for the sake of expanding his domain, he only wants to rebuild and let both of our peoples prosper.”</p><p>He gestured towards the letter still clutched in the King’s hand. “The lands he offers, the peace he extends, these are not empty words. They are restitution. Words cannot change the past, but they <em>can</em> hold new futures.” He looked directly into King Stynn’s eyes. “Let us write a future we don't regret.”</p><p>The king’s fingers drummed on the arms of his throne, eyes darting between Faux and the Archbishop, before resting somewhere in the ceilings above. </p><p>“A new king, they may have. But the denizens of that kingdom are the same. Have you all forgotten?” The Archbishop turned and stared each of the many advisors down. “These are the same people who hung our men from their intestines. You would have us treat with these barbarians?” He roared.</p><p>“The Archbishop raises a valid concern,” the king started slowly, “The Veylands have given us little reason to trust them.”</p><p>He paused, the hall remained silent and tense.</p><p>“But..” His gaze lingered on the litter, as if every part of him was conflicted. “...King Salem offers what his predecessor did not. Lands. Trade. Peace.”</p><p>Then I saw the Archbishop do what no other man could dare, he walked up the dais, holding out his arm over the edge for the servants to catch the vile liquid from beneath. He trudged up the stairs to the highest throne, not bowing, but standing proud. </p><p>“You would trust in Salem’s emissaries? They came to us requesting peace talks, yet they came late. They insult our kingdom,” he turned around, pointing at us with his decrepit hand, then turned back to Stynn. “They insult you, my king.”  </p><p>The young boy seated just below and to the right of the king spoke up. “He’s right, why have they come late? To keep his Eminence waiting shows contempt, not the respect you claim.”</p><p>I saw Rowan shoot the slightest glare in Faux’s direction. All eyes in the room had turned to look at us, to see how we would defend our <em>king’s</em> honor as his emissaries. But Faux faltered, and it seemed like the very air grew hotter in the room. </p><p>I moved to step forward, Kalandyr pulled on my arm. </p><p>“Don’t!” He hissed, I saw the faintest glow in his violaceous eyes.</p><p>I pulled my arm away from him and stepped forward anyway. Gasps rippled through the lesser advisors, some edged forward in their seats. I was not the messenger and so I was forbidden to speak unless spoken to.</p><p> The room was quiet and all eyes were on me. Even the Archbishop, still standing beside the king’s throne, narrowed his eyes and tilted his down at me.</p><p>“We were attacked by bandits. Bandits from Greyport’s own lands,” I projected my voice, letting it bounce off the distant walls of the chamber. “The bandits stole our king’s missive, and when we demanded for its return, they laughed at us, saying, ‘Can’t even protect your letter, how will you hold the peace?’ Look at the bandages on her hand—we did not escape unscathed.” I pointed toward Kerra’s hand. “Do not, for even a moment, believe we did not do our utmost best to deliver Salem’s message.”</p><p>I spared a glance at Faux, who gave me the briefest of nods.</p><p>“Then how did you get the letter back?” The king’s son queried.</p><p>I appealed to something they had to accept, lest they deny The Light guides the faithful. “Only through The Light’s guidance did we find them, and when we did…” I just shook my head, letting the lie settle in. “The letter remained untouched. By The Light’s mercy.”</p><p>“By The Light’s protection, eh? And your own?” The Archbishop asked.</p><p>I let the question remain unanswered. The Archbishop’s eyes met my own. But I stood my ground. <em>He could not be one of the Synechs, not with that hideous deformity.</em></p><p><em>If this falls apart, I could run. The docks aren’t far. I don’t owe anyone here anything.</em></p><p>“Enough Mesa!” The king growled at the Archbishop. Then more quietly and only for the man beside him, he added, “We have had an increasing bandit problem, it is plausible enough. They speak truthfully.”</p><p>Only through the revelations of The Sight did I catch that last bit. Kalandyr’s eyes flickered to the throne, he’d heard it too. To everyone else it was a distant whisper.</p><p>“Bandits, really?” Mesa’s eyes flickered to mine and Kalandyr’s. “Men with eyes like theirs don’t fall to common thieves. They’ve come here for more than what they claim.” Mesa hissed back, still quiet enough that only the king’s son may have heard.</p><p>“You insult us! You insult our guests.” The king’s voice rose, enough so that some of the nearer advisors could hear.</p><p>“I insult no one. I may not see the revelations woven into our world, but I see they mean to make a fool of you.” Then loud enough for everyone to hear, he said, “Peace does not exist. It is only a fragile dream<strong>.</strong> The blade is always half drawn.”</p><p>“You’ve been reading too much of that Hierophant’s dogmatic ramblings. I will not have you tarry on this discussion any longer.”</p><p>“Father, perhaps you ought to—” The king’s son started.</p><p>“Silence, boy.” Stynn cut across. “That is enough from the both of you. I know what is best for these lands.” The King rose from his seat, his leg trembling as he pushed off the arms of the throne. He spread his arms out and said, “I accept King Salem’s offer of peace, and pray for the successes of both our kingdoms. We will reconvene on the morrow to discuss trade, borders and the future of our treaty. Until then, you are my guests.”</p><p>I would no doubt be chewed out by Kalandyr later, but I had sold our story—<em>for now</em>. We just had to make it true.</p><p>The Archbishop, Mesa, looked down at me, rage lingering in his eyes. Regardless of if he was with the Synod or not, he had some notions about The Sight, and that could mean trouble for us. </p><p>After Faux’s concluding words, a guard led us out of the chamber hall, out of the palace through the gardens to the stable where they kept our horses. The guard escorted us to the Eastern wing of the palace, the guest quarters reserved for dignitaries. </p><p>The rooms were rich and comfortable. Stone walls hung with thick tapestries, beds with clean linens and a stained window peering down at the city below, which had begun to light up as the sun went down. A servant brought some bread, cheese and a local drink made with milk, then left us to settle in.</p><p>“That went well, right?” I turned to Faux and Rowan.</p><p>Faux let out a long breath and dropped onto one of the narrow beds, “Well enough. We’re still alive, and the king’s accepted the offer.”</p><p>Rowan leaned against the wall, “He needs this, you saw his eyes when he read that letter—he’s desperate.”</p><p>“The Archbishop though…” Mysha frowned. “Mesa. He’s not biting it.”</p><p>“No,” Faux agreed. “But he’s just one voice. An important one, but still just the one.” He turned to look at me. “You almost threw it to the vipers with that stunt of yers, Rand’ar. But…” He nodded approvingly, “Quick thinking. That bandit story—it was smart.”</p><p>Kalandyr said nothing, his eyes were distant.</p><p>“It was reckless, but it worked.” Rowan folded his arms. “Now we just need to make it true, or seem true enough.” He turned to look at Faux, “How are we getting the guards out of this city?”</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about that,” I started slowly, finishing the last of the bread. I’d been thinking since that moment in the hall. “We escalate the bandit reports, until Stynn can’t ignore it. Make it look like a real crisis at the borders. We wait till he deploys his legions, and then Astaron swoops in.”</p><p>Everyone went silent for a moment, considering my proposal. </p><p>“It’s possible,” Kalandyr nodded slowly. “When the Archbishop and the king were arguing, I heard them whisper something about a growing bandit predicament, so it won’t take much to make it seem like it’s spiraling out of control.”</p><p>“You heard their whispers?” Rowan tilted his head. “They were thirty or forty feet away, that can’t be.”</p><p>“He’s got a good ear,” Faux said, throwing around a rusty coin at the ceiling and catching it before it falls. “It’s why we brought him.” Faux shrugged.</p><p>Among all the Bellators at The Gauntlet, only Lord Astaron and Faux knew about The Sight.</p><p>“Sure, but how do we grow the problem without getting our own hands dirty?” Rowan asked.</p><p>“That’s easy,” Faux chuckled. “We bribe merchants to report attacks on their caravans. Pay off a few scouts to bring in word of raids from the outer villages. You know how talk spreads. ‘Fore long, whole city’ll be fidgetin’ itself half to death.”</p><p>“You have the coin for that?” Rowan raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Well, err… Astaron gave us a bit for the journey, but we… we used most of it on the journey here. I was hopin’ you’d have some saved up, seein’ as you’ve been workin’ the docks these years.”</p><p>The truth was, we had brought money, but against mine and Kalandyr’s will, Faux had given it to the slaves to help them on their path. We only had enough left to eat for the next few days. </p><p>“Of course,” Rowan threw his hands up. “Seems to me you’re always asking me for my money, just like in Ashford.”</p><p>“That one’s not fair and ya know it,” Faux chuckled. “Besides, it’s not like ya got a family to take care of or anythin’, Astaron’ll pay you back for it.”</p><p>“Speaking of vipers,” Mysha said with a sly grin, cutting the planning short. “I’ve heard they’re everywhere in Greyport. In the gardens, in the streets, some even nest in the attics.”</p><p>Kerra’s face went pale. She shifted uncomfortably on the edge of a bed, gripping the pale sheets. “Vipers, of course there’s vipers.” Her voice came out in between shivers. “Probably in the walls… in the beds… waiting in the sheets.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “Hate this city already,” she grumbled.</p><p>I retreated from the group and stared out the window. The streets had gone quiet, and the rain had picked up again. <em>The plan was going well, but do I really want to be here? </em>I asked myself.</p><p>I looked into the distance, where the mist curled around the buildings, veiling what lay beyond. <em>Somewhere out there in the distance, the dockyards await. My only ticket home.</em></p><p>A pit formed in my stomach just thinking about it. Would I abandon my team in the critical moment? </p><p><em>Yes. I would if it meant I got home, </em>a part of me whispered. </p><p>Astaron had made it clear what would happen if I tried to leave, but I was willing to risk Faux and Kalandyr’s blades if it meant seeing them again. My family.</p><p><em>What if Minarra had gotten sick? What if Daryen had done something reckless?</em> The thoughts got darker and darker. <em>What if someone had died?</em> The last one hit me like a knife to the gut. <em>It would be my fault, I’d left them like Father and Mother had left us. I’d left Remi to fend for herself, to raise the other two.</em> A lone tear slipped down my cheek. </p><p>I had to try. For myself. </p><p>I’d always believed that the best decision is the one I’d least regret. And sitting there, in that foreign city, plotting a war I didn’t fully understand, it was clear which one that was. </p><p>I knew I’d regret not trying to go home. Even if it got me killed.</p><p>So I waited. I waited till Mysha and Kerra had retreated to the adjoining chamber. I waited till Faux and the others had slipped into the dreams of night. </p><p>I slipped on my garb, pulled down my hood, took one last weary look at where Kalandyr slept, terrified I’d see the purple glow behind me. My hand hovered over the knob, shivering in that warm room. </p><p><em>They might call me a coward. A deserter. Astaron might hunt me down. But they weren’t the ones who’d left a family behind.</em></p><p>I gripped my arm with my other hand to stop the shaking. I turned the knob and slipped into the hallway.</p><p>The corridor was empty save for a lone guard that yawned at the far end of the hallway, facing away. </p><p>The time was ripe.</p><p>I turned down the stairs and slipped into the mists of night.</p><p><a id=\"_2sows18xsgg2\"></a>"
